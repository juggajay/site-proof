## Important Notes on VicRoads Specification Numbering

VicRoads uses a dual numbering system for specifications:
- **200 series** = Formation (e.g., Section 204 Earthworks)
- **300 series** = Pavement construction (e.g., Section 304 Unbound Flexible Pavement, Section 306 Cementitious Treated Subbase, Section 307 In-Situ Stabilisation)
- **400 series** = Asphalt and surface treatments (e.g., Section 407 Dense Graded Asphalt)
- **800 series** = Material specifications (e.g., Section 812 Crushed Rock, Section 815 CTCR)

The user brief referenced Sections 401, 402, 404 which appear to be from an older or alternative numbering. The current VicRoads equivalents used in this document are:
- Section 401 (Unbound) --> **Section 304** (Unbound Flexible Pavement Construction) + **Section 812** (Crushed Rock)
- Section 402 (CTCR) --> **Section 306** (Cementitious Treated Pavement Subbase) + **Section 815** (CTCR material)
- Section 404 (Stabilised) --> **Section 307** (In-Situ Stabilisation of Pavements with Cementitious Binders)
- Section 407 (DGA) --> **Section 407** (Dense Graded Asphalt) - same number confirmed

Hold points are identified in VicRoads specifications by the letters **HP** in the left margin and bold text. Text that is bolded but not marked HP is a specified obligation but not a formal Hold Point.
