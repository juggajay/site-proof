## 1. VicRoads Specification System Overview

### 1.1 Organisational Context

VicRoads was absorbed into the **Department of Transport and Planning (DTP)** as part of a Victorian Government restructure. Despite the organisational change, the technical specification system has been retained substantially intact. The specifications are still widely referred to as "VicRoads specifications" in the industry, and the DTP website and documents continue to host them under the VicRoads branding on `vicroads.vic.gov.au`.

- **Publishing authority:** Department of Transport and Planning (DTP), Victoria
- **Primary website:** https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/business-and-industry/technical-publications
- **DTP publications portal:** https://www.vic.gov.au/dtp-technical-publications
- **Contract documents (specification sections):** https://webapps.vicroads.vic.gov.au/VRNE/csdspeci.nsf/
- **Standards management contact:** StandardsManagementRD@transport.vic.gov.au

### 1.2 Has the "Section XXX" Numbering Been Retained?

**Yes.** The "Section XXX" numbering system has been fully retained under DTP. Specifications continue to be published as "Section 160", "Section 204", "Section 407", etc. The Index of Standard Sections was last updated on **7 December 2024**, confirming the system remains active and maintained. There has been no renumbering or restructuring of the section-based system.

The document set is officially called the **"Standard Specifications for Roadworks and Bridgeworks"**.

### 1.3 Where Are Specifications Published?

Specifications are published in two primary locations:

1. **VicRoads Contract Documents portal** -- individual .docx files for each Section:
   https://webapps.vicroads.vic.gov.au/VRNE/csdspeci.nsf/
   - Includes current and archived versions
   - Last index update: 7 December 2024

2. **DTP Technical Publications portal** -- broader publications including codes of practice, test methods, technical notes, and bridge technical notes:
   https://www.vic.gov.au/dtp-technical-publications
   - A downloadable **DTP Engineering Standards Catalogue (xlsx)** lists all current and archived documents
   - A free monthly **DTP Standards Newsletter** provides updates on changes

### 1.4 Overall Structure

## 3. Answers to the 9 Foundational Questions

### Question 1: Has the "Section XXX" numbering been retained under DTP?

**Answer: Yes.** The "Section XXX" format has been fully retained. The DTP Engineering Standards Index (last updated January 2024) and the Index of Standard Sections (last updated December 2024) both use the same Section numbering system. The overall collection remains titled "Standard Specifications for Roadworks and Bridgeworks". There has been no renumbering.

### Question 2: Does VicRoads have separate specifications for OGA and SMA, or are these covered within Section 407?

**Answer: VicRoads has SEPARATE, dedicated specifications for both:**

- **Section 404** -- Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA)
- **Section 417** -- Open Graded Asphalt (OGA)
- **Section 407** -- Dense Graded Asphalt (DGA) -- this covers DGA only

This is a key difference from the research brief's initial assumptions which guessed Section 409 for SMA and Section 410 for OGA. The correct section numbers are **404 (SMA)** and **417 (OGA)**.

Additional asphalt specifications include:
- Section 405 -- Regulation Gap Graded Asphalt
- Section 418 -- High Modulus Asphalt (EME2)
- Section 421 -- High Binder Crumb Rubber Asphalt
- Section 422 -- Light Traffic Crumb Rubber Asphalt

### Question 3: What VicRoads RC test methods are commonly referenced in ITPs?

**See Section 4 below** for the comprehensive RC Test Methods Catalogue.

### Question 4: How does VicRoads define "Lots" for acceptance testing purposes?

**Answer:** VicRoads uses a **lot-based acceptance** system governed by **Section 173** (Examination and Testing of Materials and Work) and supplemented by **RC 500.05** (Acceptance of Field Compaction) and **RC 316.00** (Density Ratio and Moisture Ratio Lot Characteristics).

**Key principles:**

1. **Lot definition:** A test lot shall consist of a single layer as placed and must contain only areas of work that are "essentially homogeneous" -- meaning the material type, general appearance, test rolling response, moisture condition during compaction, compaction technique, and state of underlying materials are substantially alike.

2. **Lot size:** The maximum lot size for measurement and assessment of surface level is **500 m**. For small lots less than 500 m^2, only three tests are required, assessed on the basis of meeting a Mean Density Ratio of 98%.

3. **Pre-test requirements:** Prior to commencement of conformance testing, the limits of the lot must be clearly identified and an identification number must be allocated to the lot.

4. **Test site selection:** RC 316.10 sets out the method for selecting and locating test sites within a test lot.

5. **Lot characteristics calculation:** RC 316.00 calculates lot characteristics (Density Ratio and Moisture Ratio) from individual test results within a lot.

6. **Lot sizes are activity-specific:** Each specification section (e.g., Section 204 for earthworks, Section 304 for pavements, Section 407 for asphalt) defines its own maximum lot sizes and minimum testing frequencies.

### Question 5: Are there VicRoads Technical Notes or Interim Advice Notes that modify ITP requirements?

**Answer: Yes.** VicRoads publishes **Technical Notes (TN series)** that supplement and sometimes modify the standard specification requirements. These are maintained in a formal index (**TN 000 -- Index of Technical Notes**, last updated August 2023).

**Key Technical Notes relevant to ITPs:**

| TN # | Title | Relevance |
|------|-------|-----------|
| TN 020 | Reducing Reflection Cracking Over Jointed Concrete Pavement | Modifies pavement requirements |
| TN 022 | Acid Sulfate Soils | Additional earthworks testing requirements |
| TN 023 | PreSpraying of Sprayed Seal Surfaces | Modifies Section 408 procedures |
| TN 030 | Alkali Silica Reaction in Concrete | Additional concrete testing for Section 610 |
| TN 038 | Cracks in Concrete | Crack assessment criteria for Section 610 |
| TN 071 | Achieving Good Ride Quality | Modifies pavement/asphalt acceptance |
| TN 078 | Guide to Planning Geotechnical Site Investigations | Pre-construction geotechnical requirements |
| TN 106 | Surveillance of Field Density Testing by Nuclear Gauge | Modifies field density test procedures |
| TN 107 | Use of Recycled Materials in Road Pavements | July 2023 -- RAP and recycled materials |
| TN 108 | Selection of Rehabilitation Treatments for Granular Pavements | Pavement rehabilitation guidance |
| TN 109 | Pavements in Poor Condition | June 2018 -- assessment and treatment |
| TN 113 | Concrete Mix Design -- Review and Registration Guidelines | Modifies concrete mix design requirements |

VicRoads does **not** appear to use a separate "Interim Advice Note" system like TMR (Queensland). Modifications to standard specifications are issued via Technical Notes, updated specification editions, or project-specific amendments. [VERIFY whether DTP has introduced any new interim advice mechanism since the VicRoads transition]

### Question 6: Does VicRoads have specific requirements for geotechnical investigation ITPs?

**Answer:** VicRoads does not have a standalone geotechnical investigation specification section within the Standard Specifications for Roadworks and Bridgeworks. However, geotechnical investigation is covered through:

1. **TN 078 -- Guide to Planning Geotechnical Site Investigations** (June 2006): This is the primary document governing pre-construction geotechnical investigations. It provides guidance on planning the scope, extent, and methods of site investigations.

2. **BTN 023 -- AS 5100 Part 3: Foundation and Soil-Supporting Structures** (v2.0, July 2023): For bridge and structure foundations, this Bridge Technical Note supplements AS 5100 with VicRoads-specific requirements.

3. **RC 500.20 -- Assignment of CBR and Percent Swell to Earthworks Fill and Pavement Materials**: Provides the framework for characterising soil materials.

4. **Section 204 (Earthworks)** contains requirements for foundation acceptance that implicitly require geotechnical investigation data.

**For SiteProof:** Geotechnical investigation ITPs would be project-specific rather than based on a standard VicRoads specification section. Template items should reference TN 078 and the relevant AS 1726 (Geotechnical Site Investigations) requirements.

### Question 7: For bridge works, does VicRoads use its own bridge spec or reference AS 5100?

**Answer: Both.** VicRoads uses a **dual system**:

1. **VicRoads Standard Specification Sections** (600-series) for construction:
   - Section 610 -- Structural Concrete
   - Section 611 -- Steel Reinforcement
   - Section 614 -- Formwork
   - Section 620 -- Precast Concrete Units
   - Section 630 -- Fabrication of Steelwork
   - Section 640 -- Sheet Piles
   - Section 660 -- Bridge Expansion Joints
   - Section 670 -- Steel Bridge Barriers
   - Section 680 -- Bonded Anchors
   - Section 691 -- Waterproofing of Concrete Bridge Decks

2. **Bridge Technical Notes (BTN series)** that supplement AS 5100 with VicRoads-specific requirements:
   - BTN 021 -- AS 5100 Part 1: Scope and General Principles
   - BTN 023 -- AS 5100 Part 3: Foundation and Soil-Supporting Structures
   - BTN 025 -- AS 5100 Part 5: Concrete

**Critical point:** Where a BTN differs from AS 5100:2017, the BTN requirements **override** those of AS 5100:2017. Compliance with Bridge Technical Notes is mandatory on DTP projects.

**Key BTNs for construction ITPs:**

| BTN # | Title | Version | Date |
|-------|-------|---------|------|
| BTN 001 | Traffic Barriers for Structures | v2.2 | August 2023 |
| BTN 002 | Bridge Approach Barriers | [VERIFY] | [VERIFY] |
| BTN 003 | Bridge Support Protection | v1.0 | January 2018 |
| BTN 004 | Bridge Joints | v1.1 | June 2018 |
| BTN 007 | Noise Attenuation Walls | v2.0 | May 2023 |
| BTN 009 | RC Panels for Reinforced Soil Structures | -- | January 2018 |
| BTN 010 | Integral and Semi-Integral Bridges | v1.1 | April 2022 |
| BTN 011 | Approach Slabs | v2.0 | May 2022 |
| BTN 014 | Road Sign and Lighting Structures | v2.3 | June 2023 |
| BTN 016 | Design of Box Culverts | v2.0 | June 2023 |
| BTN 021 | AS 5100 Part 1: Scope and General Principles | v1.3 | September 2022 |
| BTN 023 | AS 5100 Part 3: Foundation and Soil-Supporting Structures | v2.0 | July 2023 |
| BTN 025 | AS 5100 Part 5: Concrete | v2.1 | October 2022 |

### Question 8: Is there a VicRoads-specific erosion and sediment control specification?

**Answer: Yes.** VicRoads has **Section 176 -- Erosion and Sediment Control** as a dedicated specification within the Standard Specifications for Roadworks and Bridgeworks.

**Key requirements from Section 176:**

- Contractors must inspect all erosion and sedimentation control works **at least once per week**
- Additional inspections required during rain events:
  - Within **1 hour** of rain commencement during working hours
  - Every **4 hours** for continuous rain
  - Within **12 hours** of rain events outside working hours
- Defects and deficiencies must be rectified **immediately**
- Stockpiled soil must be located **no less than 10 metres** from waterways (Clause 176.D2)

**Referenced environmental guidelines:**
- **EPA Publication No. 275** -- Construction Techniques for Sediment Pollution Control
- **EPA Publication No. 480** -- Environmental Guidelines for Major Construction Sites
- **IECA (2008)** -- Best Practice Erosion and Sediment Control (International Erosion Control Association)

Section 176 establishes the VicRoads-specific requirements, while EPA Victoria guidelines (particularly EPA Publication 1834 -- Civil Construction, Building and Demolition Guide) provide the broader regulatory framework. Both must be complied with on Victorian projects.

### Question 9: Are noise wall specifications covered under a general section or dedicated spec?

**Answer: Dedicated specification.** Noise walls are covered under:

- **Section 765 -- Noise Attenuation Walls** (within the Standard Specifications)
- **BTN 007 -- Noise Attenuation Walls** (Bridge Technical Note providing design and acoustic requirements)

BTN 007 is to be read in conjunction with Section 765. This is consistent with VicRoads treating noise walls as a structural element (hence the 600/700-series placement and BTN coverage) rather than general road furniture.

VicRoads also publishes **Noise Guidelines -- Construction and Maintenance Works** for noise management during construction activities.

## 5. VicRoads Quality System

### 5.1 Conformance Report Format and Timing

Section 173 establishes the framework:

- **Conformance inspection records** of completed lots shall be compiled daily into a register or computer database
- Data must be kept up to date with records compiled **within 24 hours** of execution or completion
- Testing results are **not allowable as testing for acceptance** unless written advice has been provided to the Superintendent prior to the commencement of the test regarding whether such testing is for **in-process monitoring only** versus **acceptance testing**
- Contractors must update all relevant ITPs when documents and procedures are modified

### 5.2 Lot-Based Acceptance Approach

The VicRoads quality system is fundamentally **lot-based**. Key principles:

1. **Lot definition (RC 500.05):**
   - A test lot = a single layer as placed
   - Must contain only "essentially homogeneous" areas of work
   - Homogeneity assessed by: material type, general appearance, test rolling response, moisture condition during compaction, compaction technique, and state of underlying materials

2. **Lot identification:**
   - Prior to conformance testing, lot limits must be **clearly identified**
   - An **identification number** must be allocated to each lot

3. **Lot size:**
   - Maximum lot size for surface level assessment: **500 m** [VERIFY: this may be 500m length or 500m^2 area depending on activity]
   - Small lots (< 500 m^2): minimum 3 tests, assessed against Mean Density Ratio of 98%
   - Specific lot sizes vary by activity and are defined in each specification section

4. **Test site selection (RC 316.10):**
   - Random stratified selection of test locations within lot
   - Nuclear gauge test depth adjusted to be between 5 mm and 25 mm less than nominal layer depth

5. **Lot characteristics (RC 316.00):**
   - Calculates Density Ratio and Moisture Ratio lot characteristics from individual test results
   - Statistical assessment of lot compliance

### 5.3 Reduced Testing Level Criteria

Section 173 provides for reduced testing frequency:

- After **three consecutive lots** of like material and work have achieved the specified requirements, the Contractor may seek the **Superintendent's agreement** to reduce the frequency of testing
- Reduced frequency testing is applied to **subsequent lots** only
- **Reversion to full testing:** If any lot tested at reduced frequency **fails** to achieve the specified requirements, **all testing of all subsequent lots** shall revert to the initial (full) testing frequency
- Full testing must continue until **three consecutive lots** again achieve compliance

### 5.4 Non-Conformance Procedures

- The Contractor shall **immediately notify the Superintendent** of any lot that does not meet the specified requirements
- Non-conforming work triggers the formal non-conformance process under the contract conditions
- Options typically include: rework/rectification, acceptance with reduced payment (price adjustment), or removal and replacement

### 5.5 Superintendent Role and Powers

The **Superintendent** (equivalent to the Principal's Representative or Engineer in other jurisdictions) has significant powers:

- Must be **notified** prior to commencement of conformance testing
- Authority to **require additional trial sections** to verify compaction routines
- Authority to **approve or reject** reduced testing frequency requests
- Authority to **require reversion** to full testing frequency
- Authority to accept, reject, or require rectification of non-conforming lots
- Role in **hold point releases** -- work cannot proceed past a hold point without Superintendent approval

## 9. Items Requiring Verification [VERIFY]

The following items could not be fully confirmed from web research alone and should be verified by downloading the actual VicRoads specification documents or the DTP Engineering Standards Catalogue spreadsheet:

1. **500-series completeness:** Confirm whether Sections 501, 502, 504 exist as separate sections or if 503 is the only concrete pavement section
2. **600-series completeness:** Confirm exact section numbers for prestressed concrete, piling (bored/CFA), bearings, and any other bridgeworks sections
3. **700-series completeness:** Confirm Section 703 (Kerb and Channel), pavement marking section number, and any other 700-series sections
4. **800-series completeness:** Confirm Section 860 and any other materials sections
5. **RC test methods completeness:** The 100-series (chemistry/bitumen) test methods need full enumeration from RC 000.00
6. **Section 176 edition date:** Confirm the current edition of the ESC specification
7. **Lot size for 500m:** Verify whether this refers to 500m linear length or 500 m^2 area
8. **Piling specification:** Identify the correct VicRoads section for bored piling, CFA piling, and driven piling (may be project-specific rather than a standard section)
9. **Wire Rope Safety Barrier:** Confirm whether Section 711 is the current section or has been superseded (search results noted it as "Superseded")
10. **DTP interim advice mechanism:** Confirm whether DTP has introduced any new modification mechanism beyond Technical Notes since the VicRoads transition

**Recommended action:** Download the DTP Engineering Standards Catalogue spreadsheet from the DTP publications portal and the RC 000.00 Index of Test Methods PDF to fill in all gaps marked [VERIFY].
