The 500 series covers concrete pavements:
- Section 503: Concrete Base and Lean Mix Concrete Subbase (Template 16)

Concrete barriers do NOT have a dedicated specification section. They are specified through Standard Drawings SD 3901-3906, the F-Shape Detail Sheet, BTN 001, and reference Sections 610/703 for concrete.

### Items Requiring Verification [VERIFY]

The following items are marked [VERIFY] and require confirmation against primary specification documents:

1. **Section 503 clause numbers** -- Exact clause numbering for concrete pavement requirements needs verification against the full Section 503 document
2. **Dowel bar dimensions** -- Typical sizes (32mm dia x 450mm long at 300mm centres) are industry standard for Australian heavy-duty concrete pavements but should be verified against SD 5300/5301
3. **Tie bar dimensions** -- Typical sizes (16mm deformed x 750mm at 750mm centres) should be verified against SD 5411
4. **Thermoplastic thickness** -- 1.0-2.0mm (spray) and 2.5mm (extruded) are from APAS specifications and should be verified against Section 721
5. **Glass bead application rates** -- 400 g/m2 (spray) and 300 g/m2 (preformed) from APAS specifications should be verified against Section 721
6. **Retroreflectivity values** -- 150 mcd/m2/lux (intervention) and 350 mcd/m2/lux (initial thermoplastic) should be verified against Section 721 and RC 424.01
7. **Kerb joint spacing** -- 3.0m contraction joints, 30m expansion joints should be verified against Section 703 and AS 2876
8. **Concrete pavement tolerances** -- Some tolerance values cross-referenced from Section 703 may differ for Section 503

### Key Differences from NSW (Transport for NSW) Specifications

- VicRoads uses Section 503 for concrete pavement; NSW uses R82 (Lean-Mix Concrete Subbase) and R83 (Concrete Base)
- VicRoads concrete barrier is specified by Standard Drawings; NSW has a dedicated specification
- VicRoads uses Section 721/722 for pavement marking; NSW uses R141 (Pavement Marking)
- VicRoads test methods use "RC" prefix (e.g. RC 424.01); NSW uses "T" prefix
- VicRoads WRSB has a dedicated section (711); NSW includes within general barrier specification
- Both use AS 4049 series for pavement marking materials and AS/NZS 2009 for glass beads
