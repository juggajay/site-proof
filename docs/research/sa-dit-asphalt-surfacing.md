## 1. Overview of SA DIT Specification Framework <a name="1-overview"></a>

South Australia's Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT, formerly DPTI - Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) maintains a suite of **Roads Master Specifications** using the `RD-` prefix numbering system. These have progressively replaced the older **Division R Roadworks** specifications (Part R15, R25, R26, R27, R28, R35, etc.).

### Specification Numbering Convention

DIT uses a systematic naming convention:
- **RD** = Roads
- **BP** = Bituminous Pavements (asphalt and sprayed seals)
- **PV** = Pavement (granular, stabilised)
- **EW** = Earthworks
- **GM** = General (road design)
- **DK** = Drainage

Sub-categories:
- **S** = Supply (materials supply specifications)
- **C** = Construction (construction methodology specifications)
- **D** = Design (design and performance specifications)

### Two Generations of Specifications

DIT operates **two generations** of specifications:

| Generation | Numbering | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Old (Division R)** | Part R25, R26, R26DA, R27, R28, R35, D20 | Pre-July 2018 contracts; still referenced |
| **New (Master Spec)** | RD-BP-S1, RD-BP-S2, RD-BP-C3, RD-BP-D2, RD-BP-D4, etc. | Current master specification suite |

### Key Asphalt & Surfacing Specifications (RD-BP Series)

| Spec Number | Title | Supersedes |
|---|---|---|
| **RD-BP-S1** | Supply of Bituminous Material | Part R25 |
| **RD-BP-S2** | Supply of Asphalt | Part R27 |
| **RD-BP-C1** | Cold Planing | - |
| **RD-BP-C2** | Construction of Foamed Bitumen Stabilised Pavement | - |
| **RD-BP-C3** | Construction of Asphalt Pavement | Part R28 |
| **RD-BP-D2** | Design and Application of Sprayed Bituminous Surfacing | Part R26 / R26DA |
| **RD-BP-D3** | Surface Characteristics of Spray Seals | Part R35 (partial) |
| **RD-BP-D4** | Surface Characteristics of Flexible Pavements | Part R35 (partial) |

### Edition/Revision Dates

Based on research findings:
- **Old Division R specs**: Latest versions effective **July 2018** (R27, R28, R26, R35)
- **New RD-BP Master Specs**: Initial issue approximately **August 2023**, with updates through **2024-2025** based on document version histories observed (e.g., versions dated 31/08/2023, 31/01/2024, 30/09/2024, 31/10/2025)

|---|---|
| **Mix Design & Supply** | RD-BP-S2 Supply of Asphalt (supersedes Part R27) |
| **Construction** | RD-BP-C3 Construction of Asphalt Pavement (supersedes Part R28) |
| **Surface Performance** | RD-BP-D4 Surface Characteristics of Flexible Pavements (supersedes Part R35) |

### Mix Types (SA Nomenclature)

SA DIT uses the Austroads/AS 2150 nomenclature for dense graded asphalt:

| Mix Designation | Nominal Size | Typical Application |
|---|---|---|
| **AC7** (FineAC7) | 7 mm | Light duty wearing course |
| **AC10** (FineAC10 / AC10) | 10 mm | Wearing course, levelling course |
| **AC14** | 14 mm | Levelling, intermediate, and base layers |
| **AC20** | 20 mm | Intermediate and base layers |
| **AC14 High Binder** | 14 mm | High binder base layer |

**Binder requirements for dense graded mixes:**
- Fine dense mixes: Class C170 binder for light duty applications
- Medium to heavy duty: Polymer modified binders (A15E, A5E) may be specified

### Mix Design Requirements (RD-BP-S2 / Part R27)

- Mix design must be submitted for DIT assessment and approval
- **Compaction method**: Gyratory compactor (per AS/NZS 2891.2.2 or AGPT-T212)
- SMA and heavy-duty DGA designs: Medium duty category = 80 gyratory cycles
- **Average air voids** from production tests per mix must be within +/-0.2% from the target
- **Moisture content** of production asphalt must be less than 0.2%
- **Binder content tolerance** for samples tested must be within +/-0.3% of the job mix binder content
- Mix must comply with relevant grading envelopes specified in the specification tables
- Production tolerances must comply with AS 2150

### Additional Performance Testing Triggers (RD-BP-S2)

Additional performance testing required when:
- Total asphalt amount exceeds **5,000 tonnes per mix per calendar year**
- Special asphalt mixes including SMA10
- Additional testing also required for every **20,000 tonnes per mix per calendar year**

### Placement Temperature Requirements (RD-BP-C3 / Part R28)

- **Minimum mix temperature** at the time of first placement on the surface must comply with AS 2150 "Asphalt - A guide to good practice"
- Per AS 2150, typical minimum delivery temperatures:
  - Class 170 bitumen: approximately 130-150 degrees C
  - PMB (A15E, A5E): manufacturer's recommendations
- **Minimum compaction temperature**: Not below **120 degrees C** at time of placement

### Compaction Requirements (RD-BP-C3 / Part R28)

Compaction must comply with AS 2150, Section 13 "Compaction". Each course shall be compacted uniformly to the full depth and over the full width.

**In-situ Air Voids Acceptance Criteria** (from Part R28, Table 9.8):

| Mix Type | Layer | Min Air Voids (%) | Max Air Voids (%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC10 | Wearing & levelling | 4.0 | 8.0 |
| AC14 | Levelling, intermediate & base | 2.5 | 7.0 |
| AC20 | Intermediate & base | 2.5 | 7.0 |
| AC14 High Binder | Base | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| FineAC7 | Wearing course | 2.0 | 6.0 |
| FineAC10 | Wearing course | 2.5 | 7.0 |
| SMA | Wearing course | 2.5 | 7.0 |
| OGA | Wearing course | 18.0 | 25.0 |

**Compaction assessment method:**
- Relative compaction of a core = bulk density expressed as a percentage of mean maximum density
- Reported in in-situ air voids terms using **AS 2891.8**
- Mean maximum density = arithmetic mean of test results for that mix within a Lot
- Compliance based on analysis of random set of tests from each **Work Lot**
- Low and high characteristic values of air voids (Lvc and Hvc) calculated using statistical formulas involving mean and standard deviation

**Core extraction rules:**
- No core within 150 mm of a free edge
- No more than one core per lot within certain proximity limits
- Tests for density, air voids, and layer thickness carried out on each core

### Thickness Tolerances (RD-BP-C3 / Part R28)

- For each layer, the required thickness of asphalt must be written on the existing surface at each point where there is a specified level
- Edge planing to be undertaken for each layer to ensure minimum layer thickness is achieved
- Where asphalt is placed adjacent to kerb and gutter, the wearing course must be constructed within a tolerance of **+5 mm, -0 mm**
- Tolerances on specified lateral position of asphalt treatments: **+/-50 mm**
- Thickness compliance assessed via core measurements

### Hold Points (RD-BP-C3)

The following Hold Points apply:
1. **Crack sealing product approval** - Contractor must not use proposed crack sealing product until Hold Point released
2. **Completion of crack sealing treatment** - Pavement surfacing works must not proceed until released
3. **Pavement surface preparation** - Placement of asphalt must not occur until released
4. **Between individual layers of asphalt** - Hold Point applies between each layer
5. **Between asphalt layers and waterproof membrane** - Hold Point applies

## 3. Open Graded Asphalt (OGA) <a name="3-open-graded-asphalt"></a>

### Specification Coverage

OGA is covered **within the same specifications** as DGA - it does NOT have a separate specification:
- **RD-BP-S2** (Supply of Asphalt) - mix design and supply requirements for OGA
- **RD-BP-C3** (Construction of Asphalt Pavement) - construction requirements
- **RD-BP-D4** (Surface Characteristics of Flexible Pavements) - acceptance criteria

### Mix Design Requirements

| Property | Requirement |

| **Grading** | Uniformly graded, predominantly coarse aggregate with small amounts of fine aggregate and filler |
| **Binder film thickness** | Increased to assist durability |
| **RAP content** | **NOT permitted** in Open Graded Asphalt |

### Permeability Requirements

- OGA is designed as a permeable surface course for drainage and noise reduction
- The high air void content (18-25%) inherently provides permeability
- Specific permeability test requirements are covered in the mix design tables within RD-BP-S2

### Texture Depth

- OG14 texture depth: approximately **0.9 mm** (referenced in DIT documentation)
- Measured using the sand patch method or modified surface texture depth (pestle method) per **ATM 250**

### Binder Drain-Down Testing

- Drain-down testing is part of the mix property assessment in RD-BP-S2
- Required to ensure the modified binder (A15E) does not drain from the aggregate skeleton during transport and placement
- Mix properties of Open Graded Asphalt detailed in specification tables

### Assumed Densities for Design

| Surface Type | Assumed Density |
|---|---|
| Dense Graded Asphalt | 2,400 kg/m3 |
| Stone Mastic Asphalt | 2,400 kg/m3 |

### Fibre Content Requirements

- **Minimum 0.3% cellulose fibre by mass** must be added to reduce binder drain-down
- Nominated mix submission must include details of the **filler, fibre type, and source**

### Drain-Down Requirements

- Binder drain-down testing is required for SMA mixes
- Cellulose fibre addition (min 0.3%) is the primary drain-down prevention mechanism
- Drain-down test results form part of the mix design submission to DIT

### SMA10 as Special Mix

- SMA10 is classified as a "special asphalt mix" under RD-BP-S2
- This triggers additional performance testing requirements (see Section 2 above)

### Key Differences Between States

| Feature | SA (DIT) | QLD (TMR) | VIC (VicRoads) | NSW (TfNSW) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec structure** | Separate supply vs construction specs | Combined in MRTS30 | Combined in Sec 407 | Combined in R116 |
| **Compaction method** | Gyratory (AS/NZS 2891.2.2) | Gyratory (AGPT-T212) | Gyratory | Gyratory |
| **SMA fibre** | Min 0.3% cellulose | Similar requirement | Similar requirement | Similar requirement |
| **OGA binder** | A15E mandatory | A15E or A20E | Similar PMB requirement | PMB required |
| **RAP in OGA/SMA** | Not permitted | Limited or not permitted | Case-by-case | Restricted |
| **Roughness measure** | IRI (Quarter Car) | IRI | IRI (NAASRA) | IRI |
| **Skid resistance tool** | GripTester | GripTester | SCRIM | SCRIM / GripTester |
| **Seal design** | RD-BP-D2 (Austroads-based) | MRTS11 (Austroads-based) | Sec 408 (VicRoads method) | R106 (Austroads-based) |

### SA-Specific Characteristics

1. **Two-generation specification system**: SA is transitioning from old Division R (Part R##) to new RD-BP series. Contracts may reference either generation.
2. **Separate surface characteristics specs**: SA uniquely separates surface requirements for asphalt (RD-BP-D4) and sprayed seals (RD-BP-D3), whereas most other states combine these.
3. **GripTester for skid resistance**: SA uses GripTester rather than SCRIM (used in VIC/NSW).
4. **DPTI 397 form**: SA-specific daily record sheet for seal coat treatments.
5. **28-day curing consensus**: Industry/DIT agreed standard for primer curing before new seal application.
6. **Crack-free warranty**: 2-year no-cracking requirement for asphalt surfaces is explicitly stated.

## Limitations of This Research

1. **PDF access restricted**: The DIT website blocked direct PDF fetching (HTTP 403). Full specification text could not be extracted programmatically. The findings above are compiled from search engine snippets, cached content, and cross-referenced secondary sources.

2. **Edition dates uncertain**: The exact current edition dates for the new RD-BP master specifications could not be confirmed with certainty. The most recent version history observed suggests documents have been updated through late 2025, but specific version numbers for each RD-BP document need to be verified by downloading from the DIT portal.

3. **Specific clause numbers**: While general clause references are noted (e.g., Clause 4.3, 4.4 in R27; Table 9.8 in R28; Table 10-1 in RD-BP-D2), complete clause-by-clause mapping was not possible without full document access.

4. **RD-BP-D3**: The Surface Characteristics of Spray Seals specification was referenced but very limited detail was available in search results. This document should be downloaded and reviewed directly.

5. **Quantitative acceptance limits**: Specific numerical IRI limits, texture depth targets by mix type, and skid resistance thresholds for SA were not fully extracted. These are contained within the specification tables in RD-BP-D4 and Part R35.

**Recommendation:** Download the full PDF documents from the DIT portal links provided above to verify and supplement the information in this brief, particularly for exact clause numbers, acceptance criteria tables, and current edition dates.
