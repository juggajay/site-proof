# South Australia DIT Specifications: Road Furniture & Environmental Works

## Research Date: February 2026

## Overview

The South Australian Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT, formerly DPTI - Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure) maintains a comprehensive **Master Specification** system for road and infrastructure construction. The system was restructured from the older "Division" numbering (e.g., Division R Roadworks, Division L Landscape) to a new alphanumeric coding system (e.g., RD-BF-C1) around 2018-2019.

### Master Specification Structure

DIT specifications are organised into **eight categories** with many parts. Each specification part may include a Technical Specification referencing Australian Standards and legislation, along with necessary supplements. The categories relevant to road furniture and environmental works include:

| Category Code | Category Name | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| **RD-BF** | Roads - Barriers & Fencing | Safety barriers, wire rope, concrete barriers, fencing & gates |
| **RD-LM** | Roads - Linemarking | Pavement marking application and materials |
| **RD-EW** | Roads - Earthworks | Earthworks, geotextile supply |
| **PR-LS** | Public Realm - Landscape | Landscaping, planting, erosion control, topsoil, irrigation |
| **ST-RE** | Structures - Retaining | Reinforced soil structures, retaining walls |

### 2.1 Erosion & Sediment Control (ESC)

#### SA Approach
DIT does **NOT** have a single standalone ESC specification equivalent to QLD's MRTS52. Instead, SA uses a **multi-layered approach**:

| Document | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **EHTM** (Environment and Heritage Technical Manual) | DIT | Overarching environmental management framework for DIT projects |
| **EHTM Part 5** | DIT | Water quality management including erosion and sediment control requirements |
| **EHTM Attachment 7D** | DIT | Noise and vibration management |
| **Environment Protection (Water Quality) Policy 2015** | EPA SA | Regulatory requirement - pollutants cannot be discharged to stormwater |
| **EPA SA Code of Practice** | EPA SA | Building and construction industry code of practice |
| **Stormwater Pollution Prevention Code of Practice** | EPA SA | For local, state and federal government activities |
| **PR-LS-C5** | DIT | Erosion Control Matting specification |
| **Part L03** (Legacy) | DIT/DPTI | Erosion Control Matting (December 2017 edition, archived June 2018) |
| **Appendix C - Protecting Waterways Manual** | DIT/DPTI | Detailed water protection guidelines |

#### Key Requirements
- **SEDMP (Soil Erosion Drainage Management Plan):** Required where there is high risk of sediment pollution or total disturbed area exceeds **0.5 hectares** (per EPA SA Code of Practice).
- **Silt Fences:** Must be installed as per EHTM and EPA SA requirements.
- **Sediment Basins:** Design based on project-specific catchment analysis.
- **Rock Check Dams:** Covered within earthworks and drainage specifications.
- **Stabilised Entries:** Required at construction site access points.
- **Two-pronged approach:** Erosion controls (preventing soil erosion) and sediment controls (capturing disturbed particles). Minimising erosion reduces the need for sediment controls.
- **Erosion Control Matting:** Covered under PR-LS-C5 (new system) / Part L03 (legacy).

#### EPA SA vs DIT Requirements
DIT projects must comply with **both** the EPA SA regulatory requirements **and** DIT's EHTM guidelines. The EHTM incorporates and exceeds EPA SA minimum requirements for DIT infrastructure projects. The EPA SA Environment Protection (Water Quality) Policy 2015 provides the legal framework; DIT's EHTM provides project-specific implementation guidance.

#### Comparison to Other States
| Aspect | SA (DIT) | QLD (TMR) | VIC (VicRoads) |

## 3. CROSS-CUTTING TOPICS

---

### 3.1 Does SA/DIT Have a Master Specification Covering Multiple Road Furniture Items?

**Yes, but each item has its own specification part.** DIT's Master Specification uses the **RD-BF** (Roads - Barriers & Fencing) category code to group all road furniture/barrier specifications together, but each type has a dedicated part:

| Part | Coverage |
|---|---|
| RD-BF-C1 | Steel Beam Safety Barrier Systems (W-beam guard fence) |
| RD-BF-C2 | Wire Rope Safety Barrier Systems |
| RD-BF-C3 | Construction of Concrete Safety Barrier Systems |
| RD-BF-C4 | Supply and Installation of Fencing and Gates |
| RD-BF-D1 | Design of Roadside Safety Barriers (design standard for all barrier types) |

**RD-BF-D1** serves as the overarching design specification for all barrier types, while the C-series specs cover construction/installation. This is different from QLD's approach where MRTS16 covers multiple road furniture items in a single document, but similar to VicRoads which has separate sections (708, 711, 610) for different barrier types.

### 3.2 Are Noise Walls Covered Under a General Section or a Dedicated Specification?

Based on the research, **DIT does not appear to have a dedicated noise wall specification** within the standard Master Specification numbering system (no RD-NW or similar code was found). Noise walls on DIT projects are addressed through:

1. **Project-specific specifications** developed for each project based on noise modelling
2. **EHTM Part 7 - Noise** and Attachment 7D (Management of Noise and Vibration)
3. **DIT Fact Sheet - Reducing Transport Noise Impacts** (November 2020)
4. **Road Traffic Noise Guidelines** (SA-specific)
5. **Structural specifications** (ST-SD series) for the structural design aspects
6. **RD-BF-C4** (Fencing) may cover some acoustic fencing elements

This contrasts with QLD (MRTS15 dedicated noise barrier spec) and VIC (Sec 765 dedicated noise wall spec).

### 3.3 ESC Governance: DIT vs EPA SA

SA uses a **dual-governance model**:

| Layer | Authority | Document | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Regulatory** | EPA SA | Environment Protection (Water Quality) Policy 2015 | Legal requirements, compliance obligations |
| **Regulatory** | EPA SA | Code of Practice for Building & Construction | Practical compliance guidance |
| **Project-specific** | DIT | EHTM (Environment and Heritage Technical Manual) | DIT project-specific requirements that incorporate and may exceed EPA SA requirements |
| **Construction** | DIT | PR-LS-C5 (Erosion Control Matting) | Specific construction spec for erosion matting |
| **Design** | DIT | RD-EW-D1, RD-GM-D1 | Erosion management integrated into earthworks and road design |

**Key Finding:** DIT does NOT have a single standalone ESC specification equivalent to QLD's MRTS52. Instead, ESC requirements are distributed across multiple documents. DIT projects must comply with EPA SA regulatory requirements AND DIT's own EHTM guidelines.

## 5. KEY DIFFERENCES: SA vs QLD vs VIC

### Specification Structure

| Feature | SA (DIT) | QLD (TMR) | VIC (VicRoads) |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Name | DIT Master Specification | TMR Technical Specifications (MRTS) | VicRoads Standard Specifications |
| Coding | Category-Discipline-Type (e.g., RD-BF-C1) | MRTS## sequential (e.g., MRTS16) | Section ### (e.g., Sec 711) |
| Granularity | Very granular (separate parts per activity) | Moderate (grouped by topic) | Moderate (grouped by topic) |
| Barriers | 4 separate construction specs + 1 design | 1 combined (MRTS16) | 3+ separate sections |
| Landscaping | 12+ separate specs (PR-LS series) | 1-2 specs (MRTS51) | 1-2 specs (Sec 176/177) |
| ESC | Multi-document (EHTM + EPA SA + specs) | Single spec (MRTS52) | Single spec (Sec 176) |
| Noise Walls | Project-specific | Dedicated (MRTS15) | Dedicated (Sec 765) |

### Organisational Notes
- **SA** separates design (D-series), construction (C-series), supply (S-series), and maintenance (M-series) specifications - the most granular system.
- **QLD** combines design and construction into single MRTS documents.
- **VIC** generally combines design and construction but has separate sections.

### Common National Standards Referenced
All three states reference common Australian/Austroads standards:
- **AS 1594** - Hot-rolled steel flat products (barrier steel grades)
- **AS 3569** - Steel wire rope
- **AS 2009** - Glass beads for pavement marking
- **AS 1725** - Chain-link fabric fencing
- **AS/NZS 1604.1** - Preservative-treated wood
- **MASH** - Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (via ASBAP)
- **Austroads ATS 4230** - Construction of Concrete Safety Barriers

## 7. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS & NOTES

1. **PDF Content Access:** DIT's website returned 403 errors when attempting to directly fetch page content via automated tools. Specification details were gathered from search engine snippets, cached previews, and partial content extracts. Full clause-by-clause analysis would require downloading each PDF directly from the DIT website.

2. **Hold Points and Witness Points:** Specific hold point and witness point schedules within each specification could not be fully enumerated from search results alone. The research confirmed that hold points exist in RD-BF-C1 (documentation provision is a hold point) and RD-BF-C4 (fencing installation hold points), but complete HP/WP schedules require reading the full specification PDFs.

3. **SA-Specific Test Methods:** DIT references DPTI Procedure PC108 for pavement marking paint approval as an SA-specific procedure. Most other test methods reference national Australian Standards or Austroads test methods. Any additional SA-specific test methods would be identified within the full specification documents.

4. **Specification Currency:** The new Master Specification system (RD-BF, PR-LS, etc.) appears to be the current system. Legacy Division R/L specifications are archived but remain on the DIT website. Some projects may still reference legacy codes depending on when the contract was let.

5. **Noise Wall Gap:** The absence of a dedicated noise wall specification in the standard numbering system is a notable gap compared to QLD and VIC. This may be addressed through project-specific specifications or through structural design specifications not identified in this research.

6. **PR-LS Series Completeness:** The research identified PR-LS parts C2, C4, C5, C6, C7, C9, C11, C12, D1, D2, S1, and M1. Parts C1, C3, C8, and C10 were not found and may not exist, or may have different designations.
