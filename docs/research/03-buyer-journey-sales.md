# SiteProof Buyer Journey & Sales Intelligence Report

## Target Market: Australian Civil Contractors (10-200 employees, roads/bridges/earthworks)

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Classification:** Internal -- Sales & Marketing Strategy

---

## Executive Summary

SiteProof targets a well-defined niche: quality management for small-to-mid-sized Australian civil contractors (10-200 employees) working on roads, bridges, and earthworks. This segment represents a subset of Australia's 452,820 construction businesses, with the Civil Contractors Federation (CCF) alone representing approximately 2,000 contractor and associate members nationally.

**The opportunity is driven by three forces:**

1. **Rework costs are enormous.** Australian construction projects lose 5-12% of contract value to rework, with research showing a mean direct cost of 6.4% and indirect cost of 5.9% of contract value. Companies with consistent QA/QC processes keep rework costs under 5%, versus only 37% of companies without standards achieving the same.

2. **The status quo is fragile.** Most civil contractors in this segment manage ITPs, hold points, and NCRs using Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, and paper forms. Progress claims are assembled manually from disparate sources, consuming days of admin time and creating disputes worth millions under Security of Payment legislation.

3. **Digital adoption is accelerating.** Construction technology adoption has jumped from 26% to 37% for AI/ML alone since 2023, with an average of 6.2 technologies per company. However, 70% of contractors still have no formal technology roadmap, creating a window for purpose-built, easy-to-adopt solutions.

**Key sales findings:**

- The typical buyer is an owner-operator or operations manager (10-50 employees) or a quality/project manager champion backed by a procurement committee (50-200 employees)
- Expected sales cycle: 30-90 days for the core segment, with 48% citing training costs as the biggest adoption barrier
- The internal champion is almost always the quality manager or senior project manager who bears the daily pain of manual ITP tracking
- Deals with verified internal champions show 3x higher close rates
- The most effective channels are CCF state events, LinkedIn targeting, Google Ads ($2-13 AUD CPC), and peer referrals
- Trial periods of 14-30 days on a live project are table stakes for closing

**Recommended priority actions:**
1. Build a "champion enablement" kit for quality managers to sell internally
2. Attend CCF state events starting with NSW Earth Awards (June 2026) and Procurement Forum (May 2026)
3. Launch LinkedIn ad campaigns targeting AU civil construction decision-makers
4. Develop a 30-day guided pilot program using the customer's own project data
5. Create partnership pipeline with testing laboratories (Douglas Partners, Construction Sciences) and surveying firms

## 2. Purchase Triggers -- What Makes Civil Contractors Look

### Trigger 1: Audit Failure or Near-Miss

- Government clients (TMR, VicRoads, Transport for NSW) increasingly require digital quality records
- ISO 9001 recertification revealing documentation gaps
- Client audit finding that ITP records are incomplete or inconsistent
- **Urgency level:** HIGH -- often creates a 2-4 week buying window

### Trigger 2: Cost of Rework Becoming Visible

- Australian research shows rework costs 5-31% of contract value, with a mean of 6.4% direct cost ([Love et al., ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49280189_Calculating_total_rework_costs_in_Australian_construction_projects))
- On a $5M road project, that represents $320,000 in direct rework costs
- Companies with consistent QA/QC processes cut rework costs by 40-60% ([Procore AU](https://www.procore.com/en-au/library/quality-control-construction))
- Contractors often don't quantify rework until a particularly painful project forces the conversation
- **Urgency level:** MEDIUM -- creates interest but requires ROI quantification to close

### Trigger 3: Progress Claim Disputes

- Manual progress claim preparation takes 2-5 days per claim cycle
- Payment disputes are endemic, with SOPA adjudication as the statutory resolution mechanism ([Security of Payments Act AU](https://securityofpaymentsact.com.au/))
- Head contractors commonly delay payments 60-90 days ([Mastt Guide](https://www.mastt.com/guide/progress-claim))
- A single disputed claim can tie up $50,000-$500,000 for months
- **Urgency level:** HIGH when cash flow is impacted

### Trigger 4: Scaling the Business

- Winning a larger project or multiple simultaneous projects
- Cannot hire quality managers fast enough
- Need to maintain consistency across project teams
- Moving from 3-5 concurrent projects to 8-15
- **Urgency level:** MEDIUM-HIGH -- driven by growth timeline

### Trigger 5: Tender Requirements

- Tier 1 head contractors increasingly requiring subcontractor digital QA systems
- Government prequalification systems adding technology requirements
- Need to demonstrate quality capability to win work
- **Urgency level:** HIGH when tied to a specific tender deadline

### Trigger 6: Generational Transition

- Founder retiring, next-generation leader wanting to modernise
- New quality manager from a larger contractor expecting better tools
- Graduate engineers pushing for digital workflows
- **Urgency level:** LOW-MEDIUM -- cultural, not deadline-driven

## 3. Current Tools & Competitive Landscape

### What Civil Contractors Currently Use

| Function | Common Current Tool | Pain Points |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| ITP tracking | Excel spreadsheets, Word templates | No real-time status, version control nightmares, lost in email chains |
| Hold point sign-offs | Paper forms, wet signatures | Delays waiting for inspector, lost paperwork, no audit trail |
| NCR management | Word documents, email chains | No close-out tracking, NCRs "lost," no trending data |
| Progress claims | Excel, manual collation from timesheets/dockets | 2-5 days to prepare, frequent disputes, hard to substantiate |
| Document control | Dropbox, SharePoint, USB drives | No version control, no access control, lost documents |
| Daily diaries | Paper notebooks, basic apps | Not linked to quality records, hard to reference later |
| Inspections | SafetyCulture/iAuditor, paper checklists | Generic, not purpose-built for ITPs |

### Competitive Software Landscape

| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses vs SiteProof |
|------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Procore** ([procore.com/en-au](https://www.procore.com/en-au)) | Market leader, comprehensive platform, strong brand | Expensive, complex, overkill for SME civil contractors, quality module is generic |
| **SafetyCulture** (iAuditor) ([safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com)) | Mobile-first inspections, free tier, large template library | Generic inspection tool, not built for ITPs/hold points/NCRs specifically |
| **Sitemate/Dashpivot** ([sitemate.com](https://sitemate.com)) | Flexible forms, Australian-made, good civil case studies | No-code means customisation burden on customer, not pre-built for ITPs |
| **Assignar** | Workforce & asset scheduling, good for self-perform contractors | Scheduling-focused, quality is not the core product |
| **HammerTech** | Safety-focused, strong in Tier 1 head contractors | Safety-first, quality is secondary; priced for larger organisations |
| **Kynection** ([kynection.com.au](https://www.kynection.com.au)) | Integrated WHS + quality + ISO, Australian-made | Broader scope means less depth in any one area |
| **Autodesk Construction Cloud** ([construction.autodesk.com](https://construction.autodesk.com)) | Strong BIM integration, enterprise credibility | Complex, expensive, designed for buildings not civil |
| **Varicon** ([varicon.com.au](https://varicon.com.au)) | Civil-specific, cost management focus, claims $45K annual admin savings | Cost management focus, quality is secondary |
| **WeBuild** ([webuildcs.com](https://www.webuildcs.com/au/)) | Australian-made, cloud-based, document control | Broader construction management, not quality-specific |

### SiteProof Competitive Differentiation

SiteProof's positioning should emphasise:

1. **Purpose-built for civil quality** -- Not a generic inspection tool or a massive platform with a quality add-on
2. **ITP-native** -- ITPs, hold points, witness points, and review points are first-class entities, not custom forms
3. **Progress claims integration** -- Quality records directly feed into claim substantiation
4. **Right-sized for SMEs** -- Not stripped-down enterprise software, but designed for 10-200 employee contractors
5. **Australian-made for Australian standards** -- Built for how AU civil contractors actually work

---

## 4. The Sales Process (Recommended Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Awareness & Lead Generation (Weeks 0-4)

**Objective:** Get in front of the right people with the right message at the right time.

**Activities:**

1. **Inbound: SEO & Content**
   - Target keywords: "ITP tracking software Australia," "construction quality management software," "hold point management software," "NCR tracking construction"
   - Create case study content around specific civil pain points (rework costs, audit preparation, progress claim disputes)
   - Publish thought leadership on LinkedIn targeting civil construction quality

2. **Inbound: Google Ads**
   - Budget: $2,000-5,000/month AUD
   - Expected CPC: $2-13 AUD for construction software keywords ([Digital Nomads HQ](https://digitalnomadshq.com.au/blog/how-much-does-google-ads-cost/))
   - Target high-intent keywords: "construction ITP software," "quality management software civil," "NCR tracking software"
   - Landing page with civil-specific messaging and demo booking

3. **Outbound: LinkedIn**
   - LinkedIn ads reach 80%+ of Australian professionals ([Visionair Media](https://www.visionair.com.au/linkedin-strategy-guide-for-australian-construction-companies/))
   - Target by title (Quality Manager, Operations Manager, Director) + industry (Civil Engineering, Construction) + company size (10-200) + location (Australia)
   - Content strategy: pain-point posts, short video demos, customer testimonials
   - Direct outreach to identified champions (quality managers at civil contractors)

4. **Events & Associations**
   - Attend and/or sponsor CCF state events (see Channel Strategy section)
   - Sponsor industry publications (Roads & Infrastructure Magazine)
   - Partner with testing labs for co-marketing

### Phase 2: Qualification & Discovery (Weeks 1-3 from first contact)

**Objective:** Determine fit, identify the champion, understand current pain, and map the decision process.

**Discovery call framework (30-45 minutes):**

| Question Area | Key Questions |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Current state** | "Walk me through how your team manages ITPs today. What tools do you use?" |
| **Pain quantification** | "How many hours per week does your team spend on quality paperwork? How many NCRs are open right now?" |
| **Trigger event** | "What prompted you to look at this now? Has something changed recently?" |
| **Decision process** | "Who else would need to be involved in evaluating this? What does your approval process look like?" |
| **Timeline** | "Is there a deadline driving this -- an upcoming audit, new project, or tender?" |
| **Budget** | "Have you set aside budget for this, or would we need to build a business case together?" |
| **Competition** | "Are you looking at other solutions? What have you tried before?" |

**Qualification criteria (BANT+Champion):**

- **Budget:** Can justify $200-2,000/month based on company size
- **Authority:** Have access to final decision-maker or ARE the decision-maker
- **Need:** Currently using manual processes, experiencing measurable pain
- **Timeline:** Active buying timeframe (within 90 days)
- **Champion:** Identified internal advocate who will push the deal

### Phase 3: Demo & Value Proposition (Weeks 2-4)

**Objective:** Show the product solving THEIR specific problems, not a generic feature tour.

**Demo best practices for civil contractors:**

1. **Pre-demo preparation**
   - Request a sample ITP from the prospect (or use one matching their work type -- road, bridge, earthworks)
   - Set up a demo environment with their company name and a realistic project
   - Understand their specific civil discipline and common hold points

2. **Demo structure (45-60 minutes)**
   - **5 min:** Recap their pain points from discovery ("You told us you spend 2 days per claim...")
   - **15 min:** Walk through an ITP workflow using THEIR type of work (e.g., "Subgrade preparation" ITP for a road project)
   - **10 min:** Show hold point sign-off on mobile (live -- demonstrate the field experience)
   - **10 min:** Show NCR creation, assignment, and close-out workflow
   - **5 min:** Show progress claim generation from completed quality records
   - **5 min:** Show reporting dashboard and audit preparation
   - **10 min:** Q&A and next steps

3. **Post-demo follow-up (within 24 hours)**
   - Send personalised summary of how SiteProof addresses their specific pain points
   - Include ROI calculation based on their numbers (hours saved, rework reduction)
   - Propose pilot program with clear scope and timeline

### Phase 4: Pilot / Proof of Concept (Weeks 3-8)

**Objective:** Prove the software works on a real project with their real team.

**Pilot program structure:**

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Duration** | 30 days (14 days is too short for a civil project cycle) |
| **Scope** | 1 active project, 3-5 users (1 QM, 2-3 PMs/foremen, 1 subcontractor) |
| **Setup** | SiteProof configures their ITP templates, imports project data, sets up user accounts |
| **Success criteria** | Defined upfront: e.g., "Complete 10 hold point sign-offs, raise 2 NCRs, generate 1 progress claim" |
| **Support** | Dedicated onboarding specialist, weekly check-in calls, same-day response to issues |
| **Cost** | Free pilot (the cost of setup is the investment; do not charge for pilots) |
| **Exit criteria** | Clear go/no-go decision point with documented results |

**Critical success factors for pilots:**

- The champion (quality manager) must be actively engaged
- At least one field user (foreman/supervisor) must use the mobile app on-site
- Configure templates to match their EXISTING processes, do not try to change workflows during the pilot
- Ensure subcontractor participation (even one subcontractor signing off a hold point is powerful proof)

### Phase 5: Proposal & Negotiation (Weeks 6-12)

**Objective:** Convert the pilot into a paid contract.

**Proposal elements:**

1. **Pilot results summary** -- Quantified outcomes (hours saved, hold points completed, etc.)
2. **ROI calculation** -- Based on their company size and project volume
3. **Pricing** -- Transparent, per-user or per-project pricing
4. **Implementation plan** -- Timeline for full rollout including data migration, training, configuration
5. **Support & SLA** -- Response times, dedicated account manager for first 90 days
6. **Contract terms** -- Monthly or annual, with annual discount; no lock-in longer than 12 months

**Common negotiation points:**

| Objection | Response Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | Quantify cost of rework (6.4% of contract value) and admin time; show ROI in first month |
| "Our team won't use it" | Reference pilot results; emphasise mobile-first design for field workers |
| "We already have Procore/SafetyCulture" | Position as complementary for quality specifically; show ITP/hold point depth they lack |
| "What about our existing data?" | Offer data migration support; demonstrate CSV/Excel import capabilities |
| "Data security concerns" | Australian-hosted cloud, encryption, regular backups, data export available anytime |
| "We need to see it work longer" | Extend pilot by 2 weeks with clear decision date; do not extend indefinitely |
| "Need board approval" | Provide champion with internal business case template and ROI calculator |

### Phase 6: Onboarding & Expansion (Weeks 8-16+)

**Objective:** Ensure successful adoption and expand to more projects/users.

**Onboarding program:**

- **Week 1:** Account configuration, ITP template setup, user provisioning
- **Week 2:** Admin training (quality manager), field user training (PMs, foremen)
- **Week 3:** Go-live on first project with dedicated support
- **Week 4:** Review, adjust workflows, address issues
- **Weeks 5-8:** Expand to additional projects
- **Week 12:** Formal success review and case study opportunity

**Expansion triggers:**

- New project starts
- Additional project managers joining
- Subcontractor adoption
- Adding modules (dockets, daily diaries, claims)
- Sister companies or JV partners

## 5. Sales Cycle Benchmarks

### Expected Timelines by Segment

| Company Size | Decision Maker | Typical Cycle | Close Rate Target |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 10-30 employees | Owner/Director | 2-6 weeks | 25-35% |
| 30-80 employees | Ops Manager + Director | 4-10 weeks | 20-30% |
| 80-200 employees | Quality Manager champion + procurement | 8-16 weeks | 15-25% |

**Industry context:** B2B SaaS sales cycles average 84 days across all segments ([Optifai](https://optif.ai/learn/questions/sales-cycle-length-benchmark/)). Construction software typically falls in the 30-90 day range for mid-market, extending to 90-180 days for enterprise. Since 2022, B2B sales cycles have lengthened by 22% due to increased budget scrutiny ([Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/pipeline-performance-benchmarks-2025/)). The average B2B deal now involves 6.8 stakeholders.

### Acceleration Strategies

- Proposals sent within 24 hours of demo close 35% faster ([Optifai](https://optif.ai/learn/questions/sales-cycle-length-benchmark/))
- Deals with 3+ contacts engaged close 2.4x faster than single-threaded deals ([Digital Bloom](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/pipeline-performance-benchmarks-2025/))
- Verified champion deals show 3x higher close rates ([Close.com](https://www.close.com/blog/internal-champion-army))
- Free pilots reduce perceived risk and compress evaluation time
- Trigger-based urgency (upcoming audit, tender deadline) creates natural deadlines

- **Trade Earthmovers** ([tradeearthmovers.com.au](https://www.tradeearthmovers.com.au/)) -- Earthmoving-specific audience

### Channel 4: Strategic Partnerships (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)

**Testing Laboratories**

Testing labs are natural partners -- they are present at hold points and need to report results back to the contractor.

| Partner Type | Example Companies | Partnership Model |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Construction Materials Testing | [Douglas Partners](https://www.douglaspartners.com.au/), [Construction Sciences](https://www.constructionsciences.net/) | Integration with lab results, co-marketing, referral fees |
| Geotechnical Testing | Douglas Partners, Coffey (Tetra Tech) | Hold point notification integration |
| NATA-accredited labs | State-based testing labs | Digital test result delivery into SiteProof |

**Surveying Companies**

Surveyors work alongside civil contractors daily and attend witness/hold points.

- [Landair Surveys](https://www.landair.com.au/)
- [MinStaff Survey](https://minstaffsurvey.com/)
- State-based surveying firms
- Partnership model: Referral programme, co-branded quality workflows

**Engineering Consultancies**

Superintendent representatives and design engineers are often the ones signing off hold points.

- Smaller consultancies (10-50 people) who serve the same SME civil contractors
- Partnership model: Joint marketing, consultancy recommends SiteProof to their contractor clients

**Accounting/ERP Integrations**

- Xero and MYOB integrations for progress claim financial data
- Payapps integration for claims workflow

### Channel 5: Peer Referral & Customer Advocacy (HIGH PRIORITY, builds over time)

- Construction is a referral-driven industry -- contractors talk to each other
- Implement a formal referral programme: credit/discount for referring customers
- Create a customer advisory board of 5-10 early adopters
- Develop detailed case studies with quantified results
- Encourage customer speaking at CCF events

### Channel 6: Subcontractor-Driven Adoption (MEDIUM PRIORITY, long-term)

Subcontractor adoption creates a network effect:
- Head contractor requires subcontractors to use SiteProof for hold point sign-offs
- Subcontractor experiences the platform and adopts it for their own quality management
- This creates bottom-up demand from subcontractors asking their other head contractors to use it

**Strategy:**
- Offer free subcontractor accounts (limited functionality) on head contractor's projects
- Make the subcontractor experience excellent (simple hold point sign-off, docket submission)
- Follow up with subcontractors who have used the platform on 2+ projects

---

## 7. Objection Handling Guide

### Objection 1: "It's too expensive / we can't justify the cost"

**Response framework:**

"I understand budget is a concern. Let me share some numbers. Australian research shows rework costs an average of 6.4% of contract value. On your typical $3M project, that is $192,000. Companies using consistent QA/QC processes reduce that by 40-60%. Even a 10% improvement pays for SiteProof many times over. Beyond rework, how much time does your team spend preparing progress claims each month? If it is 2-3 days, that is $2,000-4,000 in labour cost alone."

**Supporting data:**
- Rework: 6.4% direct + 5.9% indirect cost of contract value ([Love et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49280189_Calculating_total_rework_costs_in_Australian_construction_projects))
- Admin savings: Varicon reports $45,000/year for similar-sized civil contractors ([Varicon](https://varicon.com.au/))
- Consistent QA reduces rework: 56% of companies with QA keep rework under 5% vs 37% without ([PlanRadar](https://www.planradar.com/us/cost-of-rework-construction/))

### Objection 2: "My field team won't use it / too hard to learn"

**Response framework:**

"That is the number one concern we hear, and it is valid. That is exactly why we built SiteProof mobile-first. A foreman can sign off a hold point in under 30 seconds on their phone. We do not ask anyone to change how they work -- we just replace the paper form with a digital one. During our pilot, we will train your team on-site in under an hour, and we provide same-day support if anyone gets stuck."

**Supporting data:**
- 48% of construction leaders cite training costs as the top adoption barrier ([TrueLook](https://www.truelook.com/blog/construction-technology-slow-in-adoption-how-do-we-bridge-the-gap))
- Mobile-first design reduces training time; structured onboarding improves retention by 69% ([Boxcore](https://www.boxcore.com/construction-onboarding-software-2/))

### Objection 3: "We already have Procore / SafetyCulture / [other tool]"

**Response framework:**

"Great -- those are solid platforms. [Procore] is excellent for project management and document control. What we hear from contractors who use [Procore] is that the quality module is generic -- it was not built specifically for civil ITPs with hold points, witness points, and review points. SiteProof is purpose-built for exactly that workflow. Many of our customers use SiteProof alongside [Procore] -- we handle quality, they handle everything else."

### Objection 4: "What about data security / where is our data stored?"

**Response framework:**

"Your data security is our top priority. SiteProof is hosted on Australian cloud infrastructure [Supabase/AWS Sydney region]. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use the same authentication standards as major banks. You retain full ownership of your data, and you can export everything at any time. We are happy to provide our security documentation for your IT team to review."

### Objection 5: "We need to migrate our existing data"

**Response framework:**

"We help with that. Most of our customers have ITPs in Excel and NCR logs in spreadsheets. We have a data import process that brings your existing templates and records into SiteProof. During the pilot, we will set up your existing ITP templates so you can start using them immediately. Your historical data does not disappear -- we help you bring it across."

## 8. The Champion Playbook

### Identifying the Champion

The champion is typically:
- **Quality Manager** (most common) -- bears the daily pain of manual ITP tracking
- **Senior Project Manager** -- frustrated by admin overhead reducing their time on actual project management
- **Operations Manager** -- seeing inconsistency across projects and wanting standardisation

Champions possess three traits ([Close.com](https://www.close.com/blog/internal-champion-army)):
1. **Organisational influence** -- access to the economic buyer (director/owner)
2. **Technical credibility** -- respected by peers in the project team
3. **Personal motivation** -- directly benefits from the solution (less admin, better outcomes)

### Enabling the Champion

Provide champions with tools to sell internally:

1. **Internal Business Case Template** (1-page document they can present to their director)
   - Current cost of manual quality management (hours x hourly rate)
   - Rework cost reduction potential (with industry benchmarks)
   - Tender win rate improvement potential
   - Audit readiness improvement

2. **ROI Calculator** (interactive spreadsheet or web tool)
   - Input: number of projects, average contract value, team size, hours spent on quality admin
   - Output: projected annual savings, payback period, cost per project

3. **Pilot Results Summary** (generated after the trial)
   - Hold points completed digitally vs previously
   - Time saved on specific workflows
   - User feedback quotes from their own team

4. **Executive Presentation Deck** (3-5 slides the champion can use with their boss)
   - Problem: cost of current manual processes
   - Solution: SiteProof overview (2 slides)
   - Evidence: pilot results + industry benchmarks
   - Ask: approve annual subscription at $X/month

### Champion Engagement Cadence

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Day 1 | Identify potential champion during discovery call |
| Day 3 | Send personalised value proposition based on their specific pain |
| Day 7 | Share business case template and ROI calculator |
| Day 14 | Check in on internal progress; offer to join an internal meeting |
| Day 21 | Provide additional ammunition (case study, benchmark data) |
| Day 30 | If stalled, suggest a low-risk pilot to generate internal evidence |
| Ongoing | Monthly check-in; share relevant industry news/content |

---

## 9. Pricing Strategy Considerations

### Market Context

- Construction software pricing ranges from free (SafetyCulture basic) to $500+/user/month (Procore enterprise)
- SME civil contractors expect value pricing, not enterprise pricing
- Per-user pricing is understood; per-project pricing may align better with how contractors think about costs

### Suggested Pricing Framework (for internal discussion)

| Tier | Target | Indicative Range | Includes |
|------|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Starter | 10-30 employees, 1-3 projects | $299-499/month | 5-10 users, core ITP/NCR, basic reporting |
| Professional | 30-80 employees, 3-8 projects | $499-999/month | 15-30 users, full feature set, progress claims, API |
| Enterprise | 80-200 employees, 8+ projects | $999-2,499/month | Unlimited users, dedicated support, custom integrations |

**Key pricing principles:**
- Annual commitment discount (15-20% off monthly pricing)
- Free subcontractor accounts (drives adoption and creates lock-in)
- Free pilot period (30 days, no credit card required)
- No per-project fees (contractors hate unpredictable costs)
- Clear data export so they never feel trapped

| Overall close rate | 15-25% | Leads to paying customers |
| Average sales cycle | 45-75 days | First contact to signed contract |
| Customer acquisition cost (CAC) | < 6 months LTV | Total sales+marketing spend / new customers |
| Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) per customer | $400-1,200 | Billing data |

### Channel Performance Metrics

| Channel | Key Metric | Target |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Google Ads | Cost per demo request | < $150 AUD |
| LinkedIn | Cost per qualified lead | < $200 AUD |
| Events | Leads per event | 10-25 qualified contacts |
