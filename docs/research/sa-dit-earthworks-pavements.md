## 2. Earthworks

### Specification Details

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Current Spec** | RD-EW-C1 -- Earthworks (Roads Master Specification) |
| **Legacy Spec** | Part R10 -- Construction of Earthworks |
| **Legacy Edition** | March 2017 (superseded by Master Spec for new contracts) |
| **Design Spec** | RD-EW-D1 -- Design of Earthworks for Roads |
| **Structures Spec** | ST-SP-C1 -- Earthworks for Structures |

### Scope

RD-EW-C1 covers:
- Material classification
- Site preparation (clearing, grubbing)
- Proof rolling
- Excavation (cut)
- Fill construction (embankment)
- Completed surface treatment
- Verges, levees, catch drains, earth side drains/swales
- Spreading of topsoil and mulch
- Subgrade preparation

### Material Classification

Materials are classified according to suitability for earthworks. The specification identifies:
- **Suitable Material** -- materials meeting requirements for use as fill
- **Unsuitable Material** -- materials exhibiting deformation, rutting, softness, yielding, distress or instability under proof rolling or loading; unsuitable for support of pavement or layers of fill

### Compaction Requirements

**Test Method:** DIT Department Test Procedure **TP 320** -- "Compaction Control Test - Dry Density Ratio, Moisture Variation and Moisture Ratio"

The specification uses Dry Density Ratio (DDR) as the primary acceptance criterion, determined by TP 320.

**Compaction standards referenced:**
- **Standard Compaction** (AS 1289.5.1.1) -- used for General Fill only
- **Modified Compaction** (AS 1289.5.2.1) -- used for higher-specification fill and pavement layers

**Typical SA compaction requirements (based on standard Australian practice aligned with AS 3798 and DIT specifications):**

| Fill Type / Location | Minimum DDR | Compaction Method |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| General Fill (lower embankment) | 95.0% | Standard Compaction |
| General Fill (upper embankment, top 500mm) | 98.0% | Standard Compaction |
| Select Fill / Subgrade (top 300mm) | 95.0% | Modified Compaction |
| Structural Fill (behind structures) | 95.0-100.0% | Modified Compaction |

> **Note:** The exact percentages and fill type classifications are specified in Table RD-EW-C1 12-1 of the full specification document. The values above represent typical SA requirements consistent with Australian road authority practice. Users must consult the current RD-EW-C1 specification for contract-specific requirements.

### Lot Sizes for Acceptance Testing

Testing frequency and lot sizes are detailed in the specification and the associated Process Control documentation (PC-SI1 "Site Surveys"). Where no longitudinal frequencies are provided, testing must be no more than 10 m apart.

For earthworks compaction testing, the Contractor must perform "one for one" MDD testing for each test site (i.e., one MDD determination per field density test location).

### Proof Rolling Requirements

RD-EW-C1 specifies detailed proof rolling requirements:

| Parameter | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Minimum passes** | 3 passes of heavy plant |
| **Speed** | Walking pace |
| **Equipment Option 1** | Pneumatic multi-wheel roller with mass > 24 tonnes |
| **Equipment Option 2** | Fully loaded tandem truck or water cart, minimum 10 kL capacity |
| **Contact pressure (Option 2)** | Not less than 450 kPa per tyre (front or rear wheels) |
| **Contact area (Option 2)** | Not less than 0.035 m^2 per tyre |
| **Acceptance criteria** | No deformation, rutting, softness, yielding, distress or instability |

Materials exhibiting any of the above distress under proof rolling are classified as **Unsuitable Material** and must be treated or removed.

### Subgrade Treatment Methods

The specification addresses:
- Removal and replacement of unsuitable material
- Treatment of soft/unstable subgrade
- Rock subgrade: excavated surface must be blinded with subbase material and graded, shaped and compacted to produce a tight dense surface
- Geotextile placement over soft subgrade areas (fill material must not be placed over geotextile until Hold Point released)
- Chemical stabilisation of subgrade (cross-references to RD-PV-C3 for in-situ stabilisation)

### Hold Points

Key Hold Points identified in RD-EW-C1:
- **Grubbed holes** must be inspected prior to backfilling (Hold Point)
- **Joint inspection and survey** as required by section 7.2(a) (Hold Point)
- **Inspection of joints** before fill placement (Hold Point)
- **Geotextile placement** -- fill material must not be placed over geotextile until Hold Point has been released
- **Fill placement and compaction** must not occur until the Hold Point has been released (where layer thicknesses exceed specified limits)

### Test Methods Referenced

- **TP 320** -- Compaction Control Test: Dry Density Ratio, Moisture Variation and Moisture Ratio (DIT specific)

## Summary of Key Findings for ITP Template Development

### Specification Numbers to Reference in SA ITP Templates

| Activity | Primary Spec | Supporting Specs |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Earthworks (clearing, excavation, fill, compaction, subgrade) | **RD-EW-C1** | RD-EW-D1, ST-SP-C1 |
| Unbound Granular Pavement (crushed rock base/subbase) | **RD-PV-C1** | RD-PV-S1 |
| Cement Treated Crushed Rock (plant mixed) | **RD-PV-S2** | RD-PV-S1, RD-PV-D1 |
| In-situ Stabilisation (lime/cement) | **RD-PV-C3** | RD-PV-S1, RD-PV-D1 |
| Concrete Pavement | **RD-PV-D3** | RD-PV-D1 |
| Pavement Materials Supply | **RD-PV-S1** | Part R15 Att A (grading) |
| Pavement Design | **RD-PV-D1** | Austroads AGPT02 |

### Key Hold Points for ITP Templates (Earthworks)

1. Subgrade inspection before fill placement
2. Grubbed holes inspection before backfill
3. Geotextile placement inspection before fill over geotextile
4. Joint inspection and survey
5. Proof rolling acceptance (no deformation/instability)
6. Compaction test results verification per lot/layer

### Key Hold Points for ITP Templates (Pavements)

1. Subgrade/formation approval before pavement placement
2. Material supply conformance (grading, PI, CBR)
3. Compaction testing per work lot (minimum 1 per 400 m^2, min 3 per lot for stabilisation)
4. Trial section approval (for stabilisation -- 1,000 m^2)
5. Binder spread rate verification (stabilisation)
6. Level and tolerance surveys
7. UCS test results (stabilised pavements -- 28 day)

### Limitations of This Research

1. **PDF content not directly extractable**: The DIT website returns 403 errors when attempting to fetch PDF content directly. Detailed clause-by-clause requirements (exact compaction percentages by fill type, exact grading envelopes, exact PI/CBR limits) require downloading and reviewing the actual specification PDFs.

2. **Master Spec vs Legacy**: Some projects may still reference the legacy Division R specs (Part R10, R15, R23) rather than the new Master Specs (RD-EW-C1, RD-PV-C1, etc.). The ITP templates should accommodate both referencing systems.

3. **Contract-specific requirements**: DIT Master Specifications are often supplemented by Contract-Specific Technical Requirements that may modify or add to the standard requirements. Always check the project-specific documentation.

4. **Compaction table values**: The exact compaction percentage requirements (e.g., 95% vs 98% MDD) by fill type need to be confirmed from Table RD-EW-C1 12-1 in the actual specification. The values listed in this document represent typical Australian road authority practice and are consistent with, but may not exactly match, the current SA specification.
