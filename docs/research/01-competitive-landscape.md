# Competitive Landscape Analysis: SiteProof v3

**Date:** February 2026
**Market:** Australian Civil Construction Quality Management Software
**Target Segment:** Civil contractors performing state authority contract work (roads, bridges, earthworks)

---

## Executive Summary

The Australian civil construction quality management software market is fragmented across three tiers: (1) enterprise platforms like Procore, Aconex, and Autodesk Build that serve large Tier 1 contractors but are over-engineered and overpriced for mid-market civil firms; (2) general-purpose field tools like Fieldwire, SafetyCulture, and Dashpivot that lack native civil QA workflows (lot-based ITPs, hold/witness points, NCRs linked to state authority specifications); and (3) niche AU civil-specific tools like CivilPro and CONQA that are purpose-built but have usability, cost, or feature gaps.

**The critical gap SiteProof can exploit:** No single platform natively combines lot-based ITP management with hold/witness points mapped to TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, and VicRoads specifications, evidence-backed progress claims, NCR workflows, daily diaries, and docket management --- all with genuine offline capability and pricing accessible to Tier 2-3 civil contractors running $5M-$100M in annual work.

**Key market dynamics:**
- State authorities (TfNSW, TMR, VicRoads) are increasingly mandating digital quality records, pushing contractors away from Excel/paper.
- CivilPro is the incumbent for AU civil QA but has a desktop-first architecture, a $4,400/year base fee plus per-seat costs, and mixed reviews on usability for field crews.
- Procore is investing heavily in AU civil infrastructure but its ITP/hold point workflow is generic (Action Plans module), not natively mapped to AU state specifications, and its pricing ($10K-$60K+/year) excludes most Tier 2-3 contractors.
- No competitor offers integrated evidence bundling for progress claims that links directly from lot completion and ITP sign-off data --- this is a clear SiteProof differentiator.

**SiteProof's top 3 overall differentiators:**
1. **AU civil-native ITP/hold point workflows** mapped to TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, and VicRoads specifications out of the box
2. **Evidence-backed progress claims** that auto-bundle lot completions, ITP sign-offs, test results, and photos into claim packages
3. **Accessible pricing with genuine offline** capability designed for field crews on remote civil sites

**Key Gaps and User Complaints:**
- **Pricing opacity and cost:** Consistently the #1 complaint. Non-transparent pricing is a major frustration, especially for small-mid contractors. Many report feeling locked in after initial commitment.
- **Steep learning curve:** Extensive feature set overwhelms smaller teams. Training period required.
- **ITP workflow is generic:** "Action Plans" module handles ITPs but is not natively designed for AU civil lot-based workflows. No pre-built TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, or VicRoads ITP templates. Community forum users have asked how to "create and track ITPs and checklists successfully in Procore" -- indicating the workflow is not intuitive for civil QA.
- **No lot-based QA:** Procore organizes by project/cost code, not by lot. Civil contractors must work around this structure.
- **Missing features:** Users cite inadequate forms, limited multi-selection, poor QuickBooks integration.
- **Customer service:** Reports of months-long delays in resolving issues.

**ITP / Hold Point Support:**
- Action Plans module supports ITPs with configurable templates and verification methods
- Supports hold points conceptually but lacks native TfNSW Q6 / TMR / VicRoads specification mapping
- No lot-based ITP pack concept; inspections are project-level
- Source: [Procore Action Plans](https://www.procore.com/en-sg/quality-safety/action-plans), [Procore ITP Guide](https://www.procore.com/en-au/library/inspection-and-test-plans)

**Claim/Evidence Bundling:** Separate cost management module handles financials. No auto-bundling of QA evidence into progress claims. Quality and cost data live in different modules.

**Mobile/Offline:** Good offline support --- mobile app allows uploading images, reporting issues, viewing drawings offline. Sync-on-reconnect. But offline capability is partial: not all features available offline, and data capture is limited compared to online mode. Source: [Procore Offline FAQ](https://support.procore.com/faq/can-i-use-procores-mobile-application-offline)

**AU Market Presence:** Strong. Offices in AU, dedicated AU civil infrastructure page, AU-specific case studies (Hale Corp, Edwards Construction, Quadracon). Active AU community group for civil & infrastructure.

**Switching Costs:** High. Annual contracts, extensive data migration needed, team re-training. Lock-in via ACV-based pricing.

**SiteProof's Top 3 Differentiators vs Procore:**
1. **Native lot-based ITP workflows** with pre-built TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, VicRoads templates vs Procore's generic Action Plans
2. **Pricing accessibility:** Target $2K-$10K/year vs Procore's $10K-$60K+ minimum. Purpose-built for Tier 2-3 civil contractors, not enterprise
3. **Integrated evidence-backed progress claims** linking lot completions, ITP sign-offs, and test results directly to claim packages --- something Procore cannot do without manual work across modules

- **Form tool, not QA management system:** Dashpivot digitizes forms but lacks the logic layer that manages QA workflows (lot status, hold point blocking, NCR lifecycle).
- **ITP filtering issues:** "Cannot filter ITPs and ITCs" in register view. No "eagle eye" overview of quality status.
- **Signature security concerns:** "Signatures are not very secure, anyone can modify ITCs and ITPs, tampering with the system."
- **Limited role management:** "Hard to establish more nuanced roles in the system."
- **Blue collar adoption:** "A good chunk of the issue is how hard it is for Blue Collar workers to be on top of it."
- **Minimal support for issues:** Users report Dashpivot was "fully aware of the issue and their assistance was minimal to null."
- Source: [Capterra AU Reviews](https://www.capterra.com.au/software/178010/dashpivot), [GetApp AU Reviews](https://www.getapp.com.au/reviews/114487/dashpivot), [TrustRadius Reviews](https://www.trustradius.com/products/dashpivot-by-sitemate/reviews)

**ITP / Hold Point Support:** Template-based. Dashpivot offers ITP and hold point inspection templates, and claims to handle "complex forms like SWMS and ITPs better than any other tool." However, it is a form digitization tool, not a QA management system. There is no hold point enforcement, no lot-based tracking, and no specification-driven workflow logic.

**Claim/Evidence Bundling:** None. Dashpivot is a forms/process tool with no commercial functionality.

**Mobile/Offline:** Strong. Full offline form completion, photo/video capture, GPS tagging. Stores last 300 photos and 30 forms per template offline. Auto-sync on reconnect.

### 8. FinalizeIT

**Research Note:** Extensive searching across G2, Capterra, SoftwareAdvice, and general web searches yielded no results for a product called "FinalizeIT" in the construction quality management space. This product either does not exist as a significant competitor, operates under a different name, or has negligible market presence. The most likely confusion may be with **FTQ360** (First Time Quality), which is a US-based construction quality management platform.

**FTQ360 (likely intended competitor):**
- US-based construction quality management platform
- Features digital ITPs with hold/witness points, scheduling, and inspector assignment
- Look-ahead dashboards for upcoming inspections
- Primarily US market; no significant AU presence found
- Source: [FTQ360](https://www.ftq360.com/), [FTQ360 ITP Blog](https://blog.ftq360.com/blog/how-to-create-an-inspection-and-test-plan-and-use-it-with-your-quality-software)

**SiteProof's Top 3 Differentiators vs FTQ360:**
1. **AU market focus** with pre-built TfNSW, TMR, VicRoads specification templates --- FTQ360 is US-centric
2. **Integrated progress claims and docket management** --- FTQ360 focuses purely on QA/QC
3. **Purpose-built for civil contractors** (roads, bridges, earthworks) vs FTQ360's broader construction quality focus

**Target Market:** Medium to large construction companies. Strong appeal to firms already using Autodesk design tools (AutoCAD, Revit, Civil 3D). General construction focus.

**Pricing:**
- Per-user: $135-$165/user/month ($1,625/user/year annual billing)
- Unlimited-user packages: custom quotes
- Enterprise pricing available
- Source: [Autodesk Build Pricing](https://construction.autodesk.com/pricing/autodesk-build/), [G2 Pricing](https://www.g2.com/products/autodesk-construction-cloud/pricing)

**Core Features and User Praise:**
- Comprehensive quality and safety checklist workflows
- Strong BIM integration (model coordination, clash detection)
- Issue tracking with photo documentation
- RFI and submittal management
- Daily reports with field data capture
- Markup functionality praised by field teams
- 4.4/5 G2 rating
- Source: [G2 Reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/autodesk-construction-cloud/reviews), [Capterra Reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/218046/Autodesk-Construction-Cloud/reviews/)

**Key Gaps and User Complaints:**
- **Pricing:** Expensive for smaller companies; key features "stuck behind a paywall."
- **Complexity:** Workflows can feel complex for new users; learning curve for full platform.
- **Syncing issues:** Occasional slow performance and syncing problems with large projects.
- **Limited report customization:** Forms and reports have restricted customization options.
- **Integration glitches:** Some users report problems integrating with non-Autodesk systems.
- **Not civil-specific:** General construction platform with no AU civil QA workflows.

**ITP / Hold Point Support:** Checklist-based quality management. Can create inspection templates with quality checks, but no native ITP management with lot-based tracking, hold point enforcement, or AU state authority specification mapping.

**Claim/Evidence Bundling:** Cost management module handles budgets, change orders, and forecasting. No auto-bundling of QA evidence into progress claims.

**Mobile/Offline:** Good. Projects can be synced and downloaded to mobile devices. Offline access includes files, models, sheet markups, quality checklists, RFIs, issues, and photos.

**AU Market Presence:** Available in AU but primarily through Autodesk's broader ecosystem. No AU civil-specific positioning or case studies found. Adoption driven by existing Autodesk (Civil 3D, Revit) users.

**Switching Costs:** High. Tied to Autodesk ecosystem; moving away from Autodesk Build means potentially losing BIM integration benefits. Annual subscriptions.

**SiteProof's Top 3 Differentiators vs Autodesk Build:**
1. **AU civil-native:** Pre-built for TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, VicRoads workflows vs Autodesk's generic global approach
2. **Accessible pricing:** SiteProof targets Tier 2-3 civil contractors at $2K-$10K/year vs Autodesk's $8K-$20K+ per-user costs
3. **Evidence-bundled progress claims:** Direct linkage from lot QA data to commercial claims --- Autodesk separates quality and cost into disconnected modules

## Additional AU-Specific Competitors (Discovered During Research)

### CivilPro

**Critical competitor.** CivilPro is the closest direct competitor to SiteProof in the AU civil QA space.

**Overview:** CivilPro is a real-time quality assurance and project controls software designed specifically for civil construction, developed by construction engineers. It has been a mainstay of the Australian construction industry for over a decade.

**Pricing:**
- Base plan: $4,400/year (includes Azure database, app service, blob storage)
- 1-4 seats: $792/user/year ($66/user/month)
- 5-9 seats: $660/user/year ($55/user/month)
- 10-24 seats: $594/user/year ($49.50/user/month)
- 25-49 seats: $528/user/year ($44/user/month)
- 50+ seats: Custom enterprise pricing
- Setup/training: $250/hour
- Total for 10 users: ~$4,400 + $5,940 = **$10,340/year**
- Source: [CivilPro Pricing](https://civilpro.com/pricing/)

**Key Features:**
- Lot management, ITPs, checklists, hold points
- NCRs, test requests, photo records, variations
- Payment schedules, lot quantities, progress claims
- Contract notices linked to project records
- External approver engagement from ITPs
- TMR specification-based ITP repository
- Source: [CivilPro Solutions](https://civilpro.com/solutions/), [CivilPro](https://civilpro.com/)

**Key Weaknesses:**
- **Desktop-first architecture:** Requires a desktop app for "data-heavy" work. Web app is secondary.
- **No native mobile app for field crews:** Limited field usability compared to mobile-first competitors.
- **Dated UX:** The platform has been around for over a decade; UI/UX shows its age.
- **Setup complexity:** $250/hour professional services for ITP configuration.
- **Limited reviews:** Very few public reviews on G2/Capterra, making independent assessment difficult.

**SiteProof's Top 3 Differentiators vs CivilPro:**
1. **Mobile-first, modern UX:** SiteProof is built for field crews with genuine offline mobile capability vs CivilPro's desktop-first approach
2. **Lower total cost of ownership:** No $4,400 base fee; no $250/hour setup charges; self-service ITP configuration
3. **Integrated daily diary and docket management:** CivilPro focuses on QA and payments but lacks broader field operations (diaries, dockets) in a single platform

### CONQA

**Overview:** NZ-founded QA software expanding into Australia (offices in Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney). Used by major contractors including Fulton Hogan, Downer, Sansom.

**Key Features:**
- Digital checklists with evidence capture
- Lot management for infrastructure
- Online and offline capability
- Progress-tracking and variations
- Claims support with evidence
- Source: [CONQA](https://conqa.com), [Roads & Infrastructure Magazine](https://roadsonline.com.au/the-future-is-now-with-conqa/)

**Key Weaknesses:**
- NZ-origin; still establishing AU presence
- Limited public pricing information (suggests enterprise sales model)
- Fewer AU state authority specification templates compared to CivilPro
- Primarily commercial building QA with infrastructure as a growth area

**SiteProof's Top 3 Differentiators vs CONQA:**
1. **Deeper AU civil specification mapping:** Pre-built TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, VicRoads templates vs CONQA's more generic approach
2. **Integrated daily diary, docket management, and NCR lifecycle** in a single platform
3. **Purpose-built for AU civil contractors** from day one, not expanding from NZ commercial building market

## Action Items

### Immediate (0-3 months)

1. **Validate ITP template library:** Confirm SiteProof ships with pre-built ITP templates for TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS50, and VicRoads specifications. This is the single most important competitive differentiator vs Procore, SafetyCulture, and Dashpivot. Engage with 3-5 target customers to validate template completeness.

2. **Define pricing strategy:** Research suggests the sweet spot is $200-$500/month all-in for a 5-10 person civil contractor (vs CivilPro at ~$860/month for 10 users, Procore at $800-$5,000/month). Consider:
   - Per-project pricing (civil contractors think in projects)
   - Unlimited users per project (follow Procore's model to remove adoption friction)
   - Free subcontractor access (follow HammerTech's model)

3. **Build evidence bundling demo:** The auto-bundling of lot completions, ITP sign-offs, test results, and photos into claim packages is the feature no competitor has solved well. Build a compelling demo for this workflow.

4. **Benchmark offline capability:** Test real offline workflows against Dashpivot and SafetyCulture (the offline leaders). SiteProof must match or exceed their offline experience for civil sites with no connectivity.

### Short-term (3-6 months)

5. **Target CivilPro displacement:** CivilPro's desktop-first architecture and $250/hour setup fees create a clear switching opportunity. Develop a CivilPro migration path with:
   - Import tool for CivilPro ITP data
   - Side-by-side comparison landing page
   - "Try before you buy" free trial (CivilPro has no trial)

6. **Develop AU civil case studies:** Partner with 2-3 early-adopter civil contractors on real state authority projects. Document time savings, claim accuracy improvements, and compliance benefits. No competitor (except CivilPro) has strong AU civil-specific case studies.

7. **Create content for "Procore alternative for civil contractors":** SEO opportunity. Many Tier 2-3 contractors evaluate Procore, experience sticker shock, and look for alternatives. Position SiteProof as the purpose-built, affordable civil alternative.

### Medium-term (6-12 months)

8. **Integrate with Assignar and Payapps:** These AU-focused tools handle scheduling (Assignar) and progress claims (Payapps) but lack quality management. Integration partnerships create a powerful ecosystem for civil contractors.

9. **Evaluate AI features:** Procore and HammerTech are investing in AI (photo recognition, voice transcription, auto-reporting). Assess which AI capabilities would most benefit civil QA workflows (e.g., automated defect detection from photos, natural language ITP search).

10. **Expand specification library:** Beyond TfNSW, TMR, and VicRoads, add support for Main Roads WA, DPTI SA, and other state authority specifications to capture national market.
