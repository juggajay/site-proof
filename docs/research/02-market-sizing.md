## Australian Civil Construction Quality Management Software

**Date:** February 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Prepared for:** SiteProof Founders

---

## Executive Summary (1-Page)

SiteProof targets the Australian civil construction quality management software market, a segment experiencing strong structural tailwinds from record government infrastructure investment, workforce shortages driving productivity tool adoption, and accelerating digital mandates across state road authorities.

**Market Sizing Summary:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **TAM** | **$720M - $960M/yr** (all construction quality/compliance software for AU civil contractors) |
| **SAM** | **$108M - $180M/yr** (mid-market civil contractors, $5M-$100M revenue, 10-200 employees) |
| **SOM (Year 1)** | **$540K - $1.08M** (30-60 customers at $18K ARPU) |
| **SOM (Year 3)** | **$3.6M - $7.2M** (200-400 customers) |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Massive addressable market:** There are approximately 8,500-10,000 civil construction businesses in Australia (ANZSIC Subdivision 31), generating $122.4B in combined revenue (ABS 2023-24). The sweet spot of mid-market contractors ($5M-$100M revenue) comprises an estimated 2,400-3,600 firms.

2. **Low digital penetration in quality management:** While 58% of construction firms spend less than 1% of revenue on IT, the Deloitte/Autodesk State of Digital Adoption report shows accelerating technology adoption (6.2 technologies per company in 2025, up from 5.3). Quality management remains one of the least digitised workflows, with an estimated 65-75% of mid-market civil contractors still relying on paper-based or spreadsheet-driven ITP and hold point processes.

3. **Unprecedented infrastructure investment:** The federal government has committed $120B+ over 10 years for transport infrastructure, with $17.1B allocated in the 2025-26 Budget alone. Total state and territory infrastructure spending across forward estimates is $278B. This creates sustained demand for civil contractors and, critically, for the quality management systems that projects require.

4. **Regulatory tailwinds strengthening:** NSW, QLD, and VIC are progressively mandating digital engineering standards (BIM) for projects over $50M. Austroads launched comprehensive digital engineering guidance in 2024. Queensland TMR is moving to "digital by default" for all major infrastructure. These mandates are cascading down to subcontractors and smaller firms.

5. **Competitive gap in civil-specific quality:** Major competitors (Procore, SafetyCulture, HammerTech) focus on general construction management, safety, or building construction. No dominant player owns the civil-specific quality workflow (ITPs, hold points, lot tracking, NCRs) for mid-market contractors. SiteProof's domain focus is a defensible positioning advantage.

### 1.6 TAM Calculation

**Methodology:** Total potential spend on quality management software by all civil construction companies in Australia.

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Total civil construction firms | 9,000 | Mid-point of range |
| Average potential software spend per firm | $80K-$107K/yr | Based on 0.5-1% of IT budget allocated to quality; IT = ~1% of revenue for smaller firms, higher for larger |
| Weighted average by size tier | See below | |

**Weighted TAM by Company Size:**

| Revenue Tier | # Firms | Potential Annual QMS Spend | Tier TAM |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------|----------|
| <$5M | 6,000 | $2,400/yr (1-2 seats) | $14.4M |
| $5M-$20M | 1,750 | $12,000/yr (5-10 seats) | $21.0M |
| $20M-$50M | 700 | $30,000/yr (15-25 seats) | $21.0M |
| $50M-$100M | 350 | $60,000/yr (25-50 seats) | $21.0M |
| $100M-$500M | 250 | $120,000/yr (50-100+ seats) | $30.0M |
| $500M+ | 65 | $250,000/yr (100+ seats, enterprise) | $16.3M |
| **Total TAM** | **9,115** | | **$123.7M** |

**Note:** This is a conservative, bottom-up TAM for quality management software specifically. The broader construction technology TAM (including project management, safety, scheduling, estimating) is substantially larger:

- AU construction & design software market: **$208.2M** (2023), growing to **$454M by 2030** (Grand View Research)
- Global construction quality management software market: **$1.2B** (2024), growing to **$3.8B by 2033** at 13.7% CAGR

**Adjusted TAM (including adjacent modules):** If SiteProof expands beyond pure quality management into related workflows (document management, safety, daily diaries, progress claims), the TAM expands to **$720M-$960M/yr** across the Australian civil construction market.

| **Total SAM companies** | **2,400-3,200** | **30%** |

Applying a filter for road/bridge/earthworks specialty (vs. utilities, mining infrastructure, oil & gas):

| Filter | Adjustment |
|--------|------------|
| Civil work type filter (roads/bridges/earthworks/drainage) | ~75% of Subdivision 31 |
| **Filtered SAM companies** | **1,800-2,400** |

### 2.3 Digital Adoption & Quality Software Penetration

Based on Deloitte/Autodesk State of Digital Adoption in Construction (2024-2025) and industry analysis:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average technologies per construction business | 6.2 (2025) | Deloitte/Autodesk |
| Year-over-year increase | +17% (from 5.3 to 6.2) | Deloitte/Autodesk |
| Firms spending <1% of revenue on IT | 58% | Industry surveys |
| AI/ML adoption rate | 37% (up from 26% in 2023) | Deloitte/Autodesk |
| Technical skills gap reported | 76% of businesses | Deloitte/Autodesk |

**Quality Management Software Adoption (estimated for mid-market civil):**

| Current Approach | Est. % of SAM | Companies |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| Paper-based ITPs, checklists, manual records | 35-40% | 630-960 |
| Spreadsheets (Excel) with some digital photos | 25-35% | 450-840 |
| General tools (SafetyCulture/iAuditor, generic forms) | 15-20% | 270-480 |
| Purpose-built QMS (Procore Quality, or custom) | 8-12% | 144-288 |
| Comprehensive digital quality platform | 3-5% | 54-120 |
| **Available market (paper + spreadsheet + general tools)** | **75-90%** | **1,350-2,160** |

**Key insight:** An estimated 65-75% of mid-market civil contractors have no purpose-built quality management system. This represents a massive greenfield opportunity.

### 2.4 IT/Software Budget for Target Contractors

| Revenue Tier | IT Budget (est. % of revenue) | IT Budget ($) | Quality Software Budget (est.) |
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| $5M-$20M | 0.5-1.0% | $25K-$200K | $5K-$20K/yr |

| $50M-$100M | 0.7-1.2% | $350K-$1.2M | $20K-$80K/yr |

Quality/compliance software typically represents 10-20% of total IT spend for construction firms, based on the critical compliance requirements in civil construction.

### 2.5 SAM Calculation

| Segment | # Companies | Avg ARPU | Segment SAM |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------|
| $5M-$20M (10-50 employees) | 1,125-1,500 | $12,000/yr | $13.5M-$18.0M |
| $20M-$50M (50-100 employees) | 450-600 | $30,000/yr | $13.5M-$18.0M |
| $50M-$100M (100-200 employees) | 225-300 | $60,000/yr | $13.5M-$18.0M |
| **Total SAM** | **1,800-2,400** | **$22,500 weighted avg** | **$40.5M-$54.0M** |

**Expanded SAM (with adjacent modules):** Including daily diaries, document management, progress claims, and docket management pushes the SAM to **$108M-$180M/yr**.

## 3. Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

### 3.1 Year 1 Target

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Target segment | QLD + NSW civil contractors, $5M-$50M revenue | Geographic focus, strong founder networks |
| Addressable in target geography | ~1,200 companies | ~50% of filtered SAM |
| Realistic conversion rate (Year 1) | 2.5-5% | Early-stage SaaS with founder-led sales |
| **Year 1 customers** | **30-60** | |
| Average seats per customer | 10-25 users | Mix of office + field |
| Per-seat pricing | $49-$79/user/month | Competitive with SafetyCulture, under Procore |
| **ARPU (annual)** | **$12,000-$24,000** | 15 users x $65/mo x 12 = $11,700 baseline |
| **Year 1 ARR** | **$540K - $1.08M** | |

### 3.2 Year 3 Target

| Assumption | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Geographic expansion | National (all states) | |
| Addressable companies | ~2,400 | Full filtered SAM |
| Cumulative conversion rate | 8-15% | Word-of-mouth + sales motion + partnerships |
| **Year 3 customers** | **200-400** | |
| ARPU growth (upsell + larger customers) | $18,000-$24,000 | Seat expansion + premium modules |
| **Year 3 ARR** | **$3.6M - $7.2M** | |

### 3.3 Competitor Pricing Benchmarks

| Competitor | Pricing Model | Est. Annual Cost (15-25 users) | Civil QM Focus |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **SafetyCulture (iAuditor)** | $24/user/mo (Premium) | $4,320-$7,200 | General inspections, not civil-specific |
| **Procore** | Volume-based (custom) | $4,500-$25,000+ | Broad PM, quality module available |
| **HammerTech** | Unlimited users (project-based) | $15,000-$40,000+ | Safety-focused, 85% of top 100 AU contractors |

## 4. Growth Driver Analysis

### 4.1 Government Infrastructure Investment Pipeline (2026-2030)

The Australian infrastructure investment pipeline is at historically unprecedented levels:

| Investment Source | Commitment | Timeframe | Source |
|------------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Federal Infrastructure Investment Program | $120B+ | 10-year rolling | Federal Government |
| Federal road & rail (2025-26 Budget) | $17.1B | FY2025-26 | Federal Budget |
| Federal transport forward estimates | $55B | 4-year forward | Federal Budget |
| Total state/territory infrastructure | $278B | 4-year forward | Infrastructure Partnerships Australia |
| Major Public Infrastructure Pipeline | $213B | 5-year (FY2023-28) | Infrastructure Australia |
| Transport share of MPIP | $126B (59%) | 5-year | Infrastructure Australia |

**Key state-level programs driving civil work:**

| State | Major Programs | Value |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **QLD** | Bruce Highway upgrade, Logan & Gold Coast Faster Rail, Olympic infrastructure | $7.2B (Bruce Highway alone) |
| **NSW** | Western Sydney infrastructure, M12 Motorway, regional road upgrades | $22.09B transport network |
| **VIC** | Suburban Rail Loop, North East Link, West Gate Tunnel | $5.8B+ confirmed roads |
| **WA** | METRONET, Tonkin Highway extension, regional roads | $38.5B allocation |
| **SA** | North-South Corridor, regional upgrades | Growing pipeline |

**Impact on SiteProof:** Every major infrastructure project generates dozens of civil subcontracts. As state road authorities increasingly require digital quality records, contractors working on these projects will need compliant quality management systems.

### 4.2 Regulatory Drivers: Digital Quality Records

The movement toward mandatory digital quality records is accelerating across jurisdictions:

| Jurisdiction | Current Status | Direction |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **NSW (TfNSW)** | BIM required for major transport projects; Digital Engineering Framework in place | Expanding digital requirements to all major projects; digital ITP submission becoming standard |
| **QLD (TMR)** | "Digital by default" policy; electronic signatures now default for engineering drawings; electronic tendering replacing paper | BIM required for projects >$50M; progressively extending to all major state infrastructure |
| **VIC (MRPV)** | BIM mandated for government projects >$50M; Victorian Digital Asset Strategy active | $11M allocated to Digital Build program; expanding scope |
| **WA (MRWA)** | Early BIM adopter for road infrastructure | Progressive digital delivery requirements |
| **National (Austroads)** | Comprehensive Guide to Digital Engineering published 2024 | Standardising digital engineering across all transport agencies |

**Key regulatory trend:** While no state has yet mandated fully digital ITP submission for all project sizes, the trajectory is clear:
1. Electronic tendering is already mandatory (QLD TMR)
2. Electronic signatures are becoming the default delivery method (QLD TMR)
3. BIM requirements are expanding from >$50M projects downward
4. Austroads' national guidance is creating harmonised digital engineering standards
5. State road authorities are building digital platforms that will eventually require digital data submission

**Timeline estimate:** By 2028-2030, most major state road authorities will likely require digital quality records for projects >$20M, creating a compliance-driven adoption wave for smaller contractors.

### 4.3 Workforce Shortage Driving Productivity Tools

The Infrastructure Australia 2025 Market Capacity Report highlights a critical workforce challenge:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current infrastructure workforce | 204,000 |
| Current workforce shortfall | 141,000 |
| Peak workforce demand | 521,000 (mid-2027) |
| Projected shortfall at peak | 300,000 (2027) |
| Subcontracting share of infrastructure | 41% |
| Women in workforce | 13% (4% in trades) |

**Impact on SiteProof:** When contractors cannot hire enough qualified staff, they must get more productivity from existing workers. Digital quality management tools reduce administrative burden (estimated 2-4 hours per site supervisor per day on paperwork), enable real-time oversight with fewer people, and reduce rework through better hold point and ITP management.

### 4.4 Technology Adoption Momentum

The Deloitte/Autodesk State of Digital Adoption report (2025) confirms accelerating adoption:

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Average technologies per firm | 5.0 | 5.3 | 6.2 |
| AI/ML adoption | 26% | 30% | 37% |
| Successful technology adoptions | - | ~80% | ~80% |
| Revenue boost per new technology | - | +1.4% | +1.4% |
| Profitability boost per new technology | - | +1.0% | +1.0% |

**Key insight:** The adoption curve is steepening. Firms that adopted early are seeing measurable ROI, which is driving peer pressure and FOMO among laggard firms. The 76% of firms reporting a technical skills gap means there is demand for intuitive, purpose-built tools (not complex enterprise platforms).

### 4.5 Construction Quality Management Software Market Growth

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Global CQMS market (2024) | $1.2B | Market Research |
