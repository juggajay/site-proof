# South Australia DIT Specifications: Drainage & Structural Works

## Research Summary

This document catalogues the South Australian Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT, formerly DPTI) specifications relevant to drainage and structural works in civil road and bridge construction. DIT uses a two-tier specification system:

1. **New Master Specification** (current): Uses alphanumeric codes like `RD-DK-C1`, `ST-SC-C7`
2. **Old Division-based Specification** (pre-July 2018): Uses codes like `Part R04`, `Part S15`, `Part CC05`

Both systems remain referenced in industry. The new Master Specification is the current standard for all new DIT contracts.

Bridge bearing requirements are addressed within the design specification ST-SD-D1 and the older DPTI Design Standard -- Structures (August 2013). Construction/installation requirements would be covered under ST-SS-C1 (Transportation and Erection of Structural Members) and project-specific specifications.

**Previous Design Standard:** DPTI Design Standard -- Structures (August 2013) -- now superseded by ST-SD-D1
- PDF: https://www.dit.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/114290/DPTI_Design_Standard_-_Structures_August_2013.pdf

- Free draining **finger plate type joints** preferred
- Bonded steel/rubber type joints must **not** be used
- Joints must be readily accessible for inspection, maintenance, and replacement

**Referenced Standards:**
- AS 5100.4 -- Bridge design -- Bearings and deck joints

#### Comparison with QLD and VIC

|--------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Bridge Bearings | ST-SD-D1 (design) + project specs | MRTS65 Bridge Bearings | Sec 656 Bridge Bearings |

- Once commenced, tendon stressing operation must be **completed without interruption**
- No tendon can be left in a **partially stressed condition**
- Initial force equal to **10% of the final force** must be applied to take up slack of the tendon
- Elongations must be recorded from the jack

**Anchorages:**
- Must comply with **AS/NZS 1314** -- Prestressing anchorages
- Test certificates demonstrating compliance constitute a **Hold Point**
- Anchorage steel components must be protected from corrosion by greased wrappings or plugs

**Grouting:**
- Grouting requirements specified within ST-SC-C2

**Hold Points Summary:**
1. Materials/tendon compliance evidence
2. Anchorage test certificates (AS/NZS 1314)
3. Pre-stressing release
4. Post-stressing / elongation verification

**Referenced Standards:**
- AS/NZS 1314 -- Prestressing anchorages
- AS 4672.1 -- Steel prestressing materials
- AS 5100 -- Bridge design
- AS 3600 -- Concrete structures

#### Comparison with QLD and VIC
| Aspect | SA (DIT) | QLD (TMR) | VIC (VicRoads) |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Post-Tensioning | ST-SC-C2 | MRTS70 (within Concrete spec) | Sec 612 Post-Tensioned Concrete |

### 13. Bridge Deck Waterproofing

#### Current Specification
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Spec Number** | No standalone specification identified |
| **Relevant Specs** | ST-SD-D1 (design requirements for drainage/waterproofing provisions) |

**Note:** DIT does not appear to publish a dedicated standalone master specification for bridge deck waterproofing membrane systems. Waterproofing requirements are addressed within:
- **ST-SD-D1** -- Design of Structures (design-level waterproofing and drainage provisions)
- **DPTI Design Standard -- Structures (Aug 2013)** -- waterproofing provisions
- Project-specific specifications for individual bridge contracts

#### Key Requirements (from ST-SD-D1 / DPTI Design Standard)
- Adequate measures must be taken to prevent water/liquids from:
  - Staining piers or abutments
  - Damaging bearings or restraints
  - Causing corrosion
- Drainage provisions integrated with deck joint design
- Where plate joints used: adequate drainage measures required

#### Comparison with QLD and VIC
| Aspect | SA (DIT) | QLD (TMR) | VIC (VicRoads) |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Bridge Waterproofing | ST-SD-D1 + project specs | MRTS70 (within) + project specs | Sec 691 Bridge Deck Waterproofing |

**Key Difference:** VIC has a dedicated waterproofing specification (Sec 691). SA and QLD handle this primarily through design specifications and project-specific requirements.

## PART F: KEY OBSERVATIONS AND NOTES

### 1. SA Specification Structure
SA DIT uses a highly modular specification system compared to QLD and VIC:
- **Separate supply (S) and construction (C) specs** -- e.g., ST-SC-S7 (Supply of Concrete) vs ST-SC-C7 (Placement of Concrete)
- **Separate specs per pile type** -- rather than one combined piling spec
- **Three separate steelwork specs** -- fabrication, coating, and erection
- This granularity allows project-specific selection of relevant spec parts

### 2. Naming Convention
- `RD-` = Roads division
- `ST-` = Structures division
- `-D` suffix = Design spec
- `-C` suffix = Construction spec
- `-S` suffix = Supply spec
- Second code block indicates topic area:
  - `DK` = Drainage/Kerbing
  - `EW` = Earthworks
  - `SC` = Structural Concrete
  - `SS` = Structural Steelwork
  - `PI` = Piling
  - `SP` = Structures Preparation (earthworks for structures)
  - `RE` = Retaining structures
  - `SD` = Structures Design

### 3. Hold Points Pattern
DIT uses Hold Points extensively as mandatory quality checkpoints:
- Pre-pour reinforcement/formwork inspection
- Post-excavation (before pipe installation)
- Bedding compaction methodology approval
- Pile set-out and reinforcement cage inspection
- Post-pile integrity testing results review
- Pre-stressing/post-tensioning material compliance
- Anchorage test certificates
- Mock set-up completion (steelwork fabrication)

### 4. Gaps in Publicly Available Specifications
The following topics do not appear to have standalone DIT master specifications and are likely handled through project-specific specifications or design standards:
- Bridge bearings (construction/installation)
- Bridge deck waterproofing membranes
- Specific bearing pad, levelling, grouting, and load transfer procedures

### 5. Referenced Australian Standards (Key)
| Standard | Title |
|----------|-------|
| AS 2159 | Piling -- Design and installation |
| AS 3600 | Concrete structures |
| AS 3799 | Liquid membrane-forming curing compounds |
| AS 3972 | General purpose and blended cements |
| AS 4058 | Precast concrete pipes |
| AS 4672.1 | Steel prestressing materials |
| AS 5100 | Bridge design (series) |
| AS/NZS 1314 | Prestressing anchorages |
| AS/NZS 4671 | Steel reinforcing materials |
| AS/NZS 5131 | Structural steelwork -- Fabrication and erection |
