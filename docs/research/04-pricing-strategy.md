# SiteProof Pricing Strategy Research
## Construction Quality Management Platform -- AU Civil Contractors (10-200 Employees)

**Date:** February 2026
**Status:** Research Complete -- Ready for Founder Review

---

## Executive Summary (1-Page)

SiteProof operates in a construction SaaS market growing at 10.8% CAGR (valued at USD $16.3B in 2025), where mid-market civil contractors are underserved by both enterprise platforms (Procore at $10K-$25K+/year) and lightweight tools (SafetyCulture at $19-29/user/month) that lack construction quality management depth.

**The pricing opportunity:** SiteProof's core value proposition -- automating progress claims, ITP/hold point management, and quality documentation -- delivers quantifiable ROI of $150K-$400K+ annually for a typical 20-100 person civil contractor. Using the established B2B SaaS principle of capturing 10-15% of value created, this supports pricing of $1,250-$5,000/month.

**Recommended approach:** A tiered per-user/month model with a free subcontractor tier, positioning SiteProof between lightweight field tools ($25-55/user/month) and enterprise platforms ($375+/month base). The recommended price point is **$39-69 per user/month** (AUD) across three tiers, with free access for subcontractors to drive head contractor adoption.

**Key findings:**

1. **Competitor gap exists** between SafetyCulture/Dashpivot ($19-39/user/month, limited quality management) and Procore ($10K-80K/year, overkill for SMBs). No competitor dominates ITP/hold point/progress claim automation for AU civil SMBs.

2. **Per-user pricing is the market standard** (used by Fieldwire, SafetyCulture, Dashpivot, PlanRadar, Autodesk Build). Contractors understand and accept this model.

3. **Free subcontractor access is a proven growth lever** used by HammerTech, PlanRadar, Buildertrend, and Fieldwire to create network effects.

4. **14-day trials outperform 30-day trials by 71%** in conversion rates, with B2B SaaS benchmarks showing 15-30% trial-to-paid conversion.

5. **A 20-person contractor should pay $800-$1,400/month** (10-20 paid users at $39-69); a 100-person company should pay $2,700-$7,000/month. These prices deliver obvious 10-20x ROI against the value created.

**Recommended immediate action:** Launch with a single "Professional" tier at **$49/user/month (AUD)** billed annually ($59 monthly), free for subcontractors, 14-day free trial, targeting 10-25 paid users per company for an ACV of $5,880-$14,700 per customer.

## 1. Competitor Pricing Intelligence

### 1.1 Competitor Pricing Comparison Table

| Software | Pricing Model | Starting Price | Mid-Range | Enterprise | Free Tier | Subcontractor Pricing | AU Market Presence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Procore** | Annual Construction Volume (ACV) | ~$375/mo ($4,500/yr) | $10K-25K/yr | $25K-80K+/yr | No | Included (unlimited users) | Strong (240+ AU/NZ customers) |
| **Fieldwire** (Hilti) | Per user/month | Free (5 users, 3 projects) | $54-74/user/mo | $94/user/mo + Enterprise | Yes (limited) | Included in user count | Moderate |
| **HammerTech** | ACV-based (sliding scale) | ~$89/mo (~$5K-10K/yr for GO) | Custom | Custom | No | Free for subcontractors | Strong (AU-founded) |
| **SafetyCulture** (iAuditor) | Per user/month | Free (limited) | $19-29/user/mo | Custom | Yes | Lite seats available | Very Strong (AU-founded) |
| **Dashpivot** (Sitemate) | Per user/month | ~$30-39 AUD/user/mo | ~$39 AUD/user/mo | Custom | No | Visitor access (limited) | Strong (AU-founded) |
| **Autodesk Build** | Per user/month + project/account | $39/user/mo | $89/user/mo | $139/user/mo | No (30-day trial) | N/A | Strong |
| **PlanRadar** | Per user/month | ~$35/user/mo (Basic) | $119/user/mo (Starter) | $179/user/mo (Pro) | No (30-day trial) | Free for subcontractors | Moderate |
| **Contractor Foreman** | Flat fee by tier | $49/mo (3 users) | $105/mo (Standard) | Custom | No (30-day trial) | Included | Low (US-focused) |
| **Buildertrend** | Flat fee (custom) | ~$199-499/mo | Custom | Custom | No | Free (invited) | Low (US-focused) |
| **Visibuild** | Custom quotes | Not published | Not published | Not published | No | N/A | Strong (AU-only, Tier 1-3) |

### 1.2 Key Pricing Observations

**Per-user pricing dominates the mid-market.** Five of nine competitors use per-user/month pricing. This is the model contractors expect and understand.

**The "Procore gap" is real.** Procore starts at ~$4,500/year and quickly escalates to $25K+ for mid-size contractors. This creates a large underserved segment of 10-200 employee companies who need more than SafetyCulture but cannot justify Procore.

**AU-founded competitors cluster at $25-39/user/month.** SafetyCulture ($19-29), Dashpivot (~$30-39 AUD), and HammerTech (~$89/mo starting) set the local pricing expectations.

**Free subcontractor access is table stakes.** HammerTech, PlanRadar, Buildertrend, and Fieldwire all offer free subcontractor access. This is both a growth lever and a market expectation.

**Quality-specific tools command premium pricing.** PlanRadar charges $119-179/user/month for quality-focused features. Visibuild (quality-only) does not publish pricing but targets Tier 1-3 builders with custom quotes, suggesting premium positioning.

### 1.3 What Mid-Market Contractors (10-200 Employees) Typically Pay

Based on market data:

| Company Size | Typical Monthly Software Spend | Annual Spend | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10-20 employees | $500-$2,000/mo | $6K-24K/yr | 1-3 tools, basic needs |
| 20-50 employees | $1,500-$5,000/mo | $18K-60K/yr | Multiple tools, growing complexity |
| 50-100 employees | $3,000-$10,000/mo | $36K-120K/yr | Full stack, integration needs |
| 100-200 employees | $5,000-$20,000/mo | $60K-240K/yr | Enterprise features, custom needs |

Capterra reports that 40% of construction management buyers budget $175-$350 per user per month across their entire software stack. A single tool like SiteProof should capture 15-25% of that budget.

## 2. Value-Based Pricing Analysis

### 2.1 Quantified Value Creation

SiteProof creates measurable financial value across four dimensions:

#### Value Driver 1: Progress Claim Time Savings

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Hours saved per claim | 3+ hours (conservative) |
| Claims per year | 12 (monthly billing cycle) |
| Total hours saved | 36+ hours/year |
| PM hourly cost (AU loaded) | $85-120/hour |
| **Annual value per PM** | **$3,060 - $4,320** |
| PMs per company (20-person) | 2-3 |
| PMs per company (100-person) | 8-15 |
| **Total annual value (20-person)** | **$6,120 - $12,960** |
| **Total annual value (100-person)** | **$24,480 - $64,800** |

Industry benchmark: Payapps reports claims that "once took hours are now processed in as little as two minutes." GCPay reports 70% time savings on progress claims. Conservative estimate of 50% time reduction used.

#### Value Driver 2: Accelerated Payment Cycles

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Average payment delay (AU construction) | 83 days (CFMA average) |
| Payment delay reduction with automation | 15-26 days |
| Average monthly progress claim value (20-person civil) | $150K-300K |
| Average monthly progress claim value (100-person civil) | $500K-1.5M |
| Cost of capital (short-term borrowing) | 8-12% p.a. |
| **Annual cash flow benefit (20-person)** | **$5,000 - $26,000** |
| **Annual cash flow benefit (100-person)** | **$16,000 - $130,000** |

Context: 82% of contractors now face payment waits over 30 days (up from 49% two years ago). 11.6% of AU small construction firms are owed payments more than 60 days overdue. Faster claim processing directly reduces DSO.

#### Value Driver 3: Audit Failure Prevention

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Probability of audit issue per project (without system) | 15-25% |
| Average rectification cost (civil works) | 4% of contract value |
| Typical project value (20-person civil) | $2M-$10M |
| Typical project value (100-person civil) | $10M-$50M |
| **Expected audit failure cost (20-person)** | **$12,000 - $62,500/project** |
| **Expected audit failure cost (100-person)** | **$60,000 - $312,500/project** |
| Risk reduction with proper ITP/QA system | 60-80% |
| **Annual risk-adjusted value (20-person, 3 projects)** | **$21,600 - $150,000** |
| **Annual risk-adjusted value (100-person, 8 projects)** | **$288,000 - $2,000,000** |

Australian courts consistently award full cost of rectification for defective work (Bellgrove v Eldridge [1954]). Case law example: PND Civil Group v Bastow Civil -- $269,355 in rectification costs for a single non-conformance event.

#### Value Driver 4: Operational Efficiency (Document Management, NCRs, Daily Diaries)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Admin time saved per project (document management) | 5-10 hours/week |
| NCR processing time reduction | 60-70% |
| Daily diary automation savings | 2-3 hours/day across team |
| **Estimated annual value (20-person)** | **$15,000 - $40,000** |
| **Estimated annual value (100-person)** | **$60,000 - $200,000** |

### 2.2 Total Value Created Summary

| Company Size | Progress Claims | Payment Cycle | Audit Prevention | Operations | **Total Annual Value** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20-person contractor | $6K-$13K | $5K-$26K | $22K-$150K | $15K-$40K | **$48K - $229K** |
| 100-person contractor | $24K-$65K | $16K-$130K | $288K-$2M | $60K-$200K | **$388K - $2.4M** |

### 2.3 Value Capture Pricing

The B2B SaaS standard is to capture 10-15% of value created (some sources cite 10% as the "no-brainer" threshold, while 30% is achievable with strong competitive positioning).

| Company Size | Total Value (Mid-Range) | 5% Capture | 10% Capture | 15% Capture |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20-person | $138K | $6,900/yr ($575/mo) | $13,800/yr ($1,150/mo) | $20,700/yr ($1,725/mo) |
| 100-person | $1.4M | $70,000/yr ($5,833/mo) | $140,000/yr ($11,667/mo) | $210,000/yr ($17,500/mo) |

**Implication:** Even at 5% value capture, SiteProof can justify $575-$5,833/month. At 10%, the pricing headroom is $1,150-$11,667/month. This confirms that per-user pricing of $39-69/user/month is well within the "no-brainer" ROI zone.

## 3. Willingness-to-Pay Analysis

### 3.1 Price Sensitivity by Company Size

| Segment | Employees | Likely Paid Users | Monthly WTP | Annual WTP | "No Brainer" Price | "Expensive" Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small civil | 10-20 | 5-10 | $400-$800 | $4,800-$9,600 | $300/mo | $1,500/mo |
| Mid civil | 20-50 | 10-25 | $800-$2,500 | $9,600-$30,000 | $700/mo | $4,000/mo |
| Large mid-market | 50-100 | 20-50 | $2,000-$5,000 | $24,000-$60,000 | $1,500/mo | $8,000/mo |
| Upper mid-market | 100-200 | 30-80 | $3,000-$8,000 | $36,000-$96,000 | $2,500/mo | $15,000/mo |

### 3.2 "No Brainer" Price Point Analysis

For a **20-person civil contractor**:
- Total annual value created: ~$138K (mid-range)
- "No brainer" = 2-3% of value = **$230-$345/month**
- Realistic "easy yes" price = **$500-$900/month** (10-15 users at $49-59/user)
- ROI at this price: 12-23x (exceeds the 10x threshold contractors expect)

For a **100-person civil contractor**:
- Total annual value created: ~$1.4M (mid-range)
- "No brainer" = 2-3% of value = **$2,333-$3,500/month**
- Realistic "easy yes" price = **$2,500-$5,000/month** (40-75 users at $49-69/user)
- ROI at this price: 23-56x

### 3.3 Preferred Pricing Model (Market Evidence)

Based on competitor analysis and market research:

1. **Per user/month** -- Dominant model (5/9 competitors). Contractors understand it. Scales naturally with company size. **Recommended.**
2. **Flat fee by tier** -- Used by Buildertrend, Contractor Foreman. Attractive for "all-in" pricing but harder to scale revenue with customer growth.
3. **Per project** -- Rare in SMB market. Used at enterprise level. Creates friction when contractor has variable project counts. **Not recommended.**
4. **Annual construction volume** -- Procore/HammerTech model. Too complex for SMB. Requires custom quoting. **Not recommended for launch.**

## 4. Pricing Model Evaluation

### 4.1 Per User/Month

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Pros** | Predictable, scales with company size, easy to understand, industry standard, low friction to start small |
| **Cons** | "Seat minimisation" behavior (companies limit users to save costs), revenue ceiling if users are capped |
| **Competitor benchmarks** | SafetyCulture: $19-29, Dashpivot: $30-39 AUD, Fieldwire: $54-94, PlanRadar: $35-179, Autodesk Build: $39-139 |
| **Recommended range for SiteProof** | $39-69 AUD/user/month |
| **Mitigation for seat minimisation** | Free subcontractor tier, minimum seat requirements per tier, or project-based add-on pricing |

### 4.2 Per Project/Month

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Pros** | Aligns with contractor workflows, scales with business volume, easy to forecast |
| **Cons** | Uncertain "what counts as a project," pricing complexity, typical project counts vary wildly (2-20+ concurrent) |
| **Competitor benchmarks** | $8K-12K/mo for 6 projects at enterprise level (not viable for SMB) |
| **Typical project counts** | 10-person: 1-3 concurrent, 20-person: 2-5, 50-person: 5-10, 100-person: 8-20 |
| **Verdict** | Not recommended as primary model. Could be used as add-on (additional project packs). |

### 4.3 Flat Monthly Fee by Tier

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Pros** | Simple messaging, "unlimited users" is attractive, no seat-counting friction |
| **Cons** | Leaves revenue on table for larger customers, harder to expand revenue, requires hard tier boundaries |
| **Competitor benchmarks** | Contractor Foreman: $49-$105/mo (3 users to unlimited), Buildertrend: $199-499/mo |
| **Possible tier breakpoints** | Small ($299/mo, up to 10 users), Medium ($599/mo, up to 25 users), Large ($999/mo, up to 50 users) |
| **Verdict** | Viable as alternative model. Risk of underpricing for large customers. Better as a "simplified" option if per-user creates too much friction. |

### 4.4 Custom Quotes

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Pros** | Maximises revenue per customer, aligns with enterprise expectations, flexible |
| **Cons** | Slow sales cycle, requires sales team, creates pricing opacity, alienates SMBs who want self-serve |
| **Market sensitivity** | AU mid-market contractors dislike opaque pricing. Subscription fatigue is real. Transparent pricing builds trust. |
| **Verdict** | Reserve for Enterprise tier (100+ users). All standard tiers should have published pricing. |

## 5. Recommended Pricing Options

### Option A: Per-User Tiered (RECOMMENDED)

This is the recommended launch pricing model, balancing market alignment, revenue scaling, and simplicity.

#### Pricing Table

| Tier | Price (Annual Billing) | Price (Monthly Billing) | Included Features | Target Segment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Starter** | $39/user/month | $49/user/month | Lots, ITPs, Hold Points, Daily Diary, Document Storage (5GB), 5 Projects | 10-20 employees, 1-3 projects |
| **Professional** | $59/user/month | $69/user/month | Everything in Starter + NCRs, Progress Claims, Dockets, Advanced Reporting, Unlimited Projects, 25GB Storage | 20-100 employees, 3-15 projects |
| **Business** | $89/user/month | $99/user/month | Everything in Professional + Custom Workflows, API Access, SSO, Priority Support, Unlimited Storage, Audit Trail Export | 50-200 employees, 10+ projects |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Everything in Business + Dedicated Account Manager, Custom Integrations, SLA, Training Program | 200+ employees |

#### Subcontractor Pricing
- **Free** for all tiers. Subcontractors get read-only access + form submissions + daily diary entries.
- This is a critical growth lever and matches HammerTech, PlanRadar, and Buildertrend models.

#### Revenue Projections

| Customer Profile | Paid Users | Tier | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20-person civil contractor | 10-12 users | Professional | $590-$708 | $7,080-$8,496 |
| 50-person civil contractor | 20-30 users | Professional | $1,180-$1,770 | $14,160-$21,240 |
| 100-person civil contractor | 40-60 users | Business | $3,560-$5,340 | $42,720-$64,080 |

#### Why This Model Wins
- Matches dominant market pricing model (Fieldwire, SafetyCulture, Dashpivot, Autodesk Build)
- $39-89/user sits in the "sweet spot" between lightweight tools ($19-39) and enterprise ($100+)
- Natural revenue expansion as customers add users and upgrade tiers
- Free subcontractor tier drives viral adoption
- Published pricing enables self-serve sign-up (reduces sales cycle)

---

### Option B: Flat Fee Tiers (ALTERNATIVE)

Simpler messaging, "unlimited users" appeal. Higher risk of underpricing large customers.

| Tier | Monthly Price | Users Included | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Team** | $399/month | Up to 10 | Core quality management, 5 projects |
| **Growth** | $799/month | Up to 25 | Full platform, unlimited projects |
| **Scale** | $1,499/month | Up to 50 | Full platform + API, SSO, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited | Custom integrations, SLA, training |

**Pros:** Easy to communicate, "all-in" pricing, no seat-counting anxiety.
**Cons:** A 100-person company paying $1,499/month is significantly underpriced relative to value ($1.4M annual value). Revenue ceiling per customer. Harder to expand accounts.

---

### Option C: Hybrid (Per-User + Project Packs)

Base per-user fee with project capacity add-ons.

| Component | Price |
|---|---|
| Base platform fee | $199/month |
| Per active user | $29/user/month |
| Project pack (5 projects) | $99/month |
| Additional storage (10GB) | $19/month |

**Example:** 20-person company, 12 users, 5 projects = $199 + $348 + $99 = $646/month
**Example:** 100-person company, 50 users, 15 projects = $199 + $1,450 + $297 = $1,946/month

**Pros:** Granular, aligns cost with actual usage.
**Cons:** Complex to communicate, hard to predict monthly cost, creates friction. Market research shows contractors prefer predictable pricing.

---

## 6. Free Tier and Trial Strategy

### 6.1 Free Trial Recommendation

| Parameter | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Trial length** | 14 days | 14-day trials outperform 30-day by 71% in conversion. Creates urgency while providing enough time for construction workflows. |
| **Trial type** | Full-featured (Professional tier) | Let users experience the full value. Gated features reduce activation rate. |
| **Credit card required** | No (at launch) | Reduces friction for construction users who may not have company cards ready. Transition to card-required after establishing product-market fit. |
| **Trial conversion target** | 15-25% | B2B SaaS median is 18.5%. Construction software may trend lower due to longer decision cycles. |
| **Onboarding** | Guided setup wizard + 1 sample project pre-loaded | Time to first value must be under 10 minutes. Pre-load ITP templates for AU civil works. |

### 6.2 Free Tier Strategy

A permanent free tier is **not recommended at launch** for the following reasons:

1. **Support cost:** Even free users require support, and SiteProof's team is small.
2. **Market positioning:** Free tiers can signal "cheap" to mid-market contractors who associate price with quality.
3. **Conversion complexity:** Free-to-paid conversion requires a dedicated product-led growth engine.

Instead, implement a **"Freemium for Subcontractors"** model:

| User Type | Access Level | Price | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Head contractor (decision maker) | Full platform access | Paid (per user/month) | Revenue generation |
| Subcontractor (invited) | View + submit forms, daily diary, hold point sign-offs | Free | Growth lever, data capture, network effect |
| Trial user | Full Professional tier | Free for 14 days | Conversion funnel |

### 6.3 Subcontractor Freemium as Growth Engine

This is the single most important pricing strategy recommendation.

**How it works:**
1. Head contractor signs up and pays for their team (10-50 users).
2. Head contractor invites subcontractors to collaborate on projects (free).
3. Subcontractors experience SiteProof, see its value, and request it on their own projects.
4. Subcontractors convert to paid users when they become head contractors on other projects or want full features for their own business.

**Market validation:**
- HammerTech: "HammerTech is FREE for subcontractors" -- explicit pricing page callout
- PlanRadar: "Subcontractors can be added free of charge"
- Buildertrend: "Free access for subcontractors through invitation"
- Fieldwire: Free tier for up to 5 users and 3 projects

**Expected impact:**
- Each paying company invites 20-100+ subcontractor users
- 5-10% of subcontractors convert to paying customers within 12 months
- Creates defensible network effect (switching cost increases with each connected subcontractor)

## 8. Action Items

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)

- [ ] **Validate pricing with 5-10 target customers.** Run Van Westendorp price sensitivity surveys or direct interviews with AU civil contractors (10-100 employees) to test the $39-69/user/month range.
- [ ] **Implement billing infrastructure.** Integrate Stripe with tiered pricing, annual/monthly toggle, and free subcontractor user type.
- [ ] **Build pricing page.** Transparent, published pricing with three tiers + Enterprise "Contact Us." Include ROI calculator showing value vs. cost.
- [ ] **Design subcontractor invitation flow.** Ensure frictionless free onboarding for subcontractors invited by paying customers.
- [ ] **Create ITP template library.** Pre-load AU civil ITP templates (roads, drainage, earthworks, concrete, pavements) as immediate value for trial users.

### Short-Term (Months 1-3 Post-Launch)

- [ ] **Monitor conversion metrics.** Track trial-to-paid (target: 15-25%), time-to-first-value, activation rate, and churn.
- [ ] **Implement usage-based triggers.** Send upgrade prompts when Starter users hit project limits or need NCR/Claims features.
- [ ] **Launch annual billing discount.** Offer 15-20% discount for annual commitment (industry standard).
- [ ] **Build ROI case studies.** Document 2-3 early customer results quantifying time saved and claims accelerated.

### Medium-Term (Months 3-6)

- [ ] **Evaluate pricing elasticity.** A/B test pricing page (e.g., $49 vs $59 for Professional) to measure conversion impact.
- [ ] **Introduce add-on modules.** Consider premium add-ons (advanced reporting: $199/mo, API access: $99/mo) to increase ARPU without raising base price.
- [ ] **Expand subcontractor monetisation.** Offer a paid "Subcontractor Pro" tier ($19/user/month) for subcontractors who want full features on their own projects.
- [ ] **Track net revenue retention (NRR).** Target 110%+ NRR through natural seat expansion and tier upgrades.

### Long-Term (Months 6-12)

- [ ] **Evaluate ACV-based pricing for Enterprise.** For 200+ employee companies, consider Procore-style volume-based pricing with custom quotes.
- [ ] **Consider per-project add-on for mega-projects.** For contractors with very large individual projects ($50M+), offer project-based premium features.
- [ ] **Re-evaluate pricing annually.** Adjust based on competitive moves, customer feedback, and value metric evolution.
