# SiteProof Onboarding & Implementation Research Brief

**Date:** February 2026
**Author:** Customer Success Analysis
**Audience:** SiteProof Leadership, Product, and Go-to-Market Teams

---

## 1. Executive Summary

SiteProof operates in a market where onboarding quality directly determines customer retention. Research shows that properly onboarded B2B SaaS customers are **5x more likely** to remain after the first 90 days, and 75% of users will abandon a product within the first week if they struggle getting started. In the Australian civil construction sector, these stakes are amplified by a documented technology adoption rate of just 31.9%, significant workforce resistance to digital tools, and the reality that many subcontractors lack even basic digital literacy.

**Key findings:**

- **Competitors charge $150-$500/user for implementation training** (Procore), or bundle "white-glove" onboarding into subscription pricing (HammerTech). Implementation timelines range from 2 weeks (HammerTech GO) to 8-12 weeks (Procore enterprise rollout).
- **Pre-built ITP templates are the single biggest adoption accelerator.** Competitors like Visibuild, Zutec, and CivilPro use standardised templates aligned to TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, and VicRoads specifications to eliminate the "blank canvas" problem and deliver day-one value.
- **Field worker training must be under 5 minutes per topic**, mobile-first, and mirror familiar paper forms. Foremen will not read manuals. They need large buttons, dropdowns, offline mode, and workflows that feel like filling in a form on a clipboard.
- **The 30/60/90-day framework is industry standard.** Day 30 must demonstrate a completed project with real data. Day 60 must show measurable process improvement. Day 90 must achieve self-sufficiency and expansion readiness.

**Recommended approach:** SiteProof should offer a **tiered onboarding model** -- self-serve for smaller contractors with pre-built templates and video walkthroughs, and a dedicated implementation specialist for enterprise accounts -- with a target of **first project live within 5 business days** and full operational capability at 30 days.

### 2.2 Competitor Deep Dives

#### Procore

Procore's implementation roadmap consists of five distinct phases:

1. **Plan** -- Stakeholder interviews, workflow evaluation, identify optimisation opportunities.
2. **Configure** -- Customise company settings, set up directory with users/roles, configure permissions.
3. **Launch** -- Create pilot projects, enable tools, assign admins, import budgets and schedules.
4. **Rollout** -- Phased rollout (by office, market sector, or region), training sessions by internal implementation managers.
5. **Optimise** -- Regular check-ins, certification completions, adoption tracking.

Procore's "Kickoff" initiative specifically targets the first 90 days and achieved a 3-8% lift in onboarding task completion. Field teams are onboarded through a dedicated guide with three sub-phases: invite (2-3 weeks before go-live), train (1 week before), and support (ongoing after go-live).

**Key takeaway for SiteProof:** Procore's phased approach is thorough but heavy. The 4-12 week timeline and separate implementation fees create friction for smaller civil contractors. SiteProof can differentiate with faster time-to-value.

#### Fieldwire (by Hilti)

Fieldwire emphasises rapid onboarding with a mobile-first, jobsite-first philosophy. Their implementation guide recommends:

- Identify workflows before rollout
- Create a Best Practices Guide or Quick Reference Guide
- Record training sessions as an onboarding kit
- Segment user groups by skill level or project team
- Focus training on role-relevant workflows

Fieldwire's free tier (5 users, 3 projects) serves as a natural trial/onboarding funnel. The paid tiers scale per-user from $39/month (Pro) to $89/month (Business Plus).

**Key takeaway for SiteProof:** Fieldwire's approach of "start small, expand" through a freemium model is effective for grassroots adoption. Their emphasis on recorded training as an "onboarding kit" is a low-cost, high-impact practice SiteProof should replicate.

#### HammerTech

HammerTech's "white-glove" implementation is their core differentiator. Used by 85% of the top 100 Australian contractors, they have processed over 3.6 million worker inductions. Key onboarding elements include:

- Dedicated implementation team with consultative approach
- HammerTech GO: 2-week deployment with 25 pre-built forms and 100+ checklists
- Online inductions with video, slides, review questions, pass rates, and attempt limits
- 50% of workers complete inductions before arriving on-site
- Worker self-registration for profiles and licences

**Key takeaway for SiteProof:** HammerTech proves that Australian civil contractors will adopt software when the onboarding is hands-on and the templates are pre-built. Their GO product (2-week deployment) sets the speed benchmark.

#### PlanRadar

PlanRadar claims that 91% of subcontractors find the platform easy to use with onboarding taking less than 10 minutes. They achieve this through mobile-first design and interface simplicity.

**Key takeaway for SiteProof:** The "10-minute onboarding" claim, whether literal or aspirational, sets a compelling benchmark for field-user first impressions. SiteProof's foreman experience should target similar ease.

## 3. Australian Civil Contractor Customer Expectations

### 3.1 Technology Adoption Context

The Australian construction industry faces well-documented technology adoption challenges:

- **Innovation adoption rate of 31.9%** across the sector (2020/21 data, ABS).
- Many subcontractors lack basic digital tools; some do not have email addresses or smartphones.
- Multiple disconnected systems are a common complaint: data entered multiple times across tools.
- Fear of ROI, perceived irrelevance, cost concerns, and complexity are the primary barriers.
- There is a **strong cultural preference for tradition** -- pen-on-paper schedules and field notes remain prevalent.

### 3.2 Level of Hand-Holding Expected

Based on competitor patterns and industry research, Australian civil contractors expect:

| Contractor Size | Expectation | SiteProof Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 (>$500M revenue)** | Dedicated implementation PM, customised training, data migration, executive reporting | White-glove implementation package |
| **Tier 2 ($50M-$500M)** | Guided setup, pre-configured templates, 2-3 training sessions, ongoing support | Assisted onboarding with templates |
| **Tier 3 (<$50M)** | Quick setup, minimal configuration, video guides, chat support | Self-serve with guided video walkthroughs |

Civil contractors universally expect:
- Software that **mirrors their existing paper processes** rather than imposing new workflows
- **Someone they can call** when things go wrong (phone support, not just chat/email)
- Templates that align with their **state authority specifications** (TfNSW, TMR, VicRoads)
- Offline capability for remote sites, tunnels, and areas with poor connectivity

### 3.3 Foreman Training Needs

Foremen are the critical adoption point. Research consistently shows:

- **Foremen will not read manuals or documentation.** Training must be visual, short, and contextual.
- **In-person training is ideal but not scalable.** The compromise is short video walkthroughs (under 3-5 minutes each) that can be viewed on a phone.
- **Microlearning is essential:** Train one or two features at a time, not the entire platform.
- **Peer influence matters:** If one foreman uses the tool and finds it faster, others follow. Identify and empower "champion" foremen.
- **Interface must accommodate gloved hands:** Large buttons, dropdowns, voice-to-text, minimal typing.
- **Offline mode is non-negotiable** for rural/remote civil sites.

### 3.4 Data Migration Expectations

- **Historical project data migration is important but not blocking.** Most contractors expect to start fresh with new projects and migrate historical data over time.
- For quality management specifically, **ITP templates and lot structures** are more valuable to migrate than historical records.
- **Allow 3 months** for a full data migration if required (industry benchmark).
- Manual migration is common but error-prone; SiteProof should offer CSV import tools at minimum.
- **Priority migration items:** Company directory (users, roles), active project structures, ITP templates, and open NCRs/hold points.

### 5.2 Training Video Specifications

Based on research into construction worker engagement and SaaS onboarding video best practices:

| Parameter | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Length** | 2-5 minutes maximum | Construction workers disengage after 5 min; microlearning is proven |
| **Format** | Screen recording with voiceover | Low production cost, easy to update when UI changes |
| **Resolution** | 1080p minimum | Must be clear on mobile phone screens |
| **Orientation** | Landscape for admin videos; portrait for mobile/field videos | Match the device the audience uses |
| **Narration style** | Plain Australian English, conversational tone | Match audience; avoid jargon |
| **Captions** | Always include (auto-generated + reviewed) | Noisy job sites; non-native speakers |
| **Interactive elements** | End-of-video prompt ("Now try it yourself") | Drive immediate practice |
| **Hosting** | YouTube (unlisted) embedded in knowledge base | Free, fast, reliable, analytics built in |
| **Update cycle** | Review quarterly or when UI changes significantly | Outdated screenshots destroy trust |

### 5.3 ITP Template Library Specification

The ITP template library is the **highest-impact content item** for SiteProof adoption. Pre-built templates eliminate the "blank canvas" problem and provide immediate operational value.

#### Recommended Template Set (Phase 1: 15-20 Templates)

**TfNSW Q6 Aligned:**
- Earthworks (bulk and detailed)
- Subgrade preparation
- Subbase and base course
- Asphalt surfacing
- Concrete works (structural)
- Stormwater drainage
- Erosion and sediment control
- Fencing and guardrail

**TMR MRTS Aligned:**
- MRTS01 Introduction to Technical Standards
- MRTS05 Unbound Pavements
- MRTS10 Asphalt Pavements
- MRTS21 Drainage
- MRTS51 Environmental Management

**VicRoads Section 800 Aligned:**
- Earthworks
- Pavement base and subbase
- Asphalt
- Concrete structures
- Drainage

Each template should include:
- Pre-populated inspection items with hold points, witness points, and review points
- Reference to relevant specification clause numbers
- Default acceptance criteria
- Photo/evidence requirements per item
- Customisation guidance notes

#### Template Design Principles

1. **Start opinionated, allow customisation.** Templates should work out-of-the-box for 80% of projects, with clear guidance on how to customise the remaining 20%.
2. **Mirror paper ITP formats.** Contractors transitioning from paper will adopt faster if the digital format looks familiar.
3. **Include specification references.** Each line item should reference the relevant spec clause (e.g., TfNSW Q6 Annexure Q6/C for hold points).
4. **Mark hold points clearly.** Hold points are non-negotiable in civil construction -- the interface must make these unmissable.

### 5.4 Foreman Quick-Start Guide (1-Page Specification)

The foreman quick-start guide should fit on a single A4 page (both sides) and cover only:

**Side 1: "Your 5 Daily Tasks in SiteProof"**
1. Open the app and select your project
2. Navigate to your assigned lot
3. Complete inspection checklist items (tap, photo, done)
4. Add photos with annotations if required
5. Submit your daily diary entry

**Side 2: "Quick Reference"**
- How to take and attach a photo
- How to mark a hold point as ready for inspection
- How to raise an NCR (non-conformance)
- Who to contact for help (internal champion + SiteProof support)
- QR code linking to video walkthroughs

**Design requirements:**
- Large font (minimum 14pt)
- Numbered steps with screenshots from the actual mobile app
- Lamination-ready (will be posted in site sheds)
- Available as downloadable PDF and physical print

| Day 30 | < 50% of field users active | Identify champion user, provide additional training resources |
| Day 45 | No hold points or NCRs used | Workflow training session; may indicate process mismatch |
| Day 60 | Usage declining week-over-week | Executive sponsor call; discuss workflow fit |
| Day 90 | Customer cannot articulate value | At-risk review; consider implementation reset |

### 6.3 Success Metrics Dashboard (Recommended)

SiteProof should build an internal customer health dashboard tracking:

- **Activation rate:** % of invited users who have logged in
- **Engagement depth:** Average features used per user per week
- **Field adoption rate:** % of inspections completed on mobile vs. desktop
- **Time-to-first-value:** Days from signup to first real inspection record
- **Template utilisation:** % of customers using pre-built ITP templates vs. creating from scratch
