**Subject:** South Australian Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT) standard specifications for civil road and bridge construction
**Status:** Complete -- Phase 1 Framework Document

---

## 1. Department Naming History

### Current Name
**Department for Infrastructure and Transport (DIT)**
- Formed: 7 August 2020
- Website: https://www.dit.sa.gov.au
- Social media branding uses "DFIT" (e.g., @DFITSA on Facebook/LinkedIn, @DFIT_SA on X/Twitter)
- The website URL and official documentation still uses "DIT" as the primary acronym
- Chief Executive: Jon Whelan (as of 2025)

### Previous Names (Chronological)
1. **Department for Transport, Urban Planning and the Arts** (earliest)
2. **Department of Transport and Urban Planning**
3. **Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure** (DTEI)
4. **Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure** (DPTI) -- the most commonly referenced predecessor
5. **Department for Infrastructure and Transport** (DIT) -- current, from 7 August 2020

**Important Note:** The legacy DPTI domain (dpti.sa.gov.au) still exists and redirects to dit.sa.gov.au. Many older specification documents and URLs reference DPTI. The email for Master Specification queries is DIT.MasterSpecification@sa.gov.au.

## 2. Specification Numbering Format

### Current Format (Post-September 2024 / "New" Master Specification)

SA DIT uses an **alphanumeric code system** with the format:

```
[Category]-[Discipline]-[Type][Number]
```

Where:
- **Category** = Two-letter prefix identifying the specification category:
  - `RD` = Roads
  - `ST` = Structures
  - `PC` = Project Controls
  - `PR` = Public Realm
  - `RL` = Railway
  - `MN` = Maintenance
  - `MR` = Marine
  - `TP` = Transport Planning
  - `TN` = Tunnels
- **Discipline** = Two or three-letter sub-discipline code (see detailed list below)
- **Type** = Single letter indicating document type:
  - `C` = Construction specification
  - `D` = Design specification
  - `S` = Supply specification
  - `M` = Maintenance specification
- **Number** = Sequential number within the type

**Examples:**
- `RD-EW-C1` = Roads - Earthworks - Construction 1 (Earthworks)
- `RD-PV-D1` = Roads - Pavement - Design 1 (Pavement Investigation and Design)
- `ST-SC-C7` = Structures - Structural Concrete - Construction 7 (Placement of Concrete)
- `PC-QA1A` = Project Controls - Quality Assurance 1A (Quality Management Requirements)

### Roads Discipline Codes
| Code | Discipline |
|------|-----------|
| BF | Barriers and Fencing |
| BP | Bituminous Pavements / Surfacing |
| DK | Drainage and Kerbing |
| EL | Electrical / Lighting |
| EW | Earthworks |
| GM | General / Geometric / Road Design |
| ITS | Intelligent Transport Systems |
| LM | Linemarking / Signs / Delineation |
| PT | Public Transport |
| PV | Pavement |

### Structures Discipline Codes
| Code | Discipline |
|------|-----------|
| BF | Bridge Fittings (Bearings, Joints) |
| PI | Piling |
| RE | Retaining / Earth Structures |
| SC | Structural Concrete |
| SD | Structural Design |
| SP | Structural Preparation (Earthworks for Structures) |
| SS | Structural Steelwork |

### Project Controls Discipline Codes
| Code | Discipline |
|------|-----------|
| CN | Construction (Management, Handover, Temporary Works) |
| CS | Community / Stakeholder |
| EDM | Engineering & Design Management |
| ENV | Environmental |
| H | Heritage |
| IN | Interpretation / Glossary |
| PM | Project Management |
| QA | Quality Assurance |
| SC | Site Contamination |
| SI | Site Investigation / Survey |
| SM | Site / Traffic Management |
| ST | Sustainability |
| US | Utility Services |
| WHS | Work Health and Safety |

### Legacy Format (Pre-July 2018)

Prior to the current system, SA used a **Division + Part** numbering system:
- **Division G** = General
- **Division R** = Roadworks (e.g., Part R10 Construction of Earthworks, Part R15 Supply of Pavement Materials, Part R27 Supply of Asphalt)
- **Division S** = Structures
- **Division D** = Design and Construct (e.g., Part D01 Design and Construct Preliminaries, Part D20 Design Roadworks)

The transition from the old "Part R/S/G/D" format to the new "RD-XX-YN" format occurred around July 2018, with the current system being a comprehensive restructure released with the September 2024 edition.

## 6. Relationship to Austroads

SA DIT Master Specifications are **standalone documents** that function as **jurisdictional supplements to Austroads guides**. They are NOT simply Austroads documents with SA amendments appended. Key characteristics:

1. **Standalone but referencing:** Each specification part is a self-contained DIT document that references relevant Australian Standards (AS/NZS), Austroads guides, and DIT test procedures as needed.

2. **Austroads supplement function:** Certain design-type specifications explicitly serve as SA's jurisdictional supplement to specific Austroads publications. For example:
   - `RD-GM-D1` (Road Design) is the SA jurisdictional supplement to AGRD (Austroads Guide to Road Design)
   - `RD-DK-D1` (Road Drainage Design) clarifies and enhances the Austroads Guide to Road Design and Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR)
   - `RD-PV-D1` (Pavement Investigation and Design) supplements Austroads pavement design guidance

3. **Cross-referencing:** Many parts cross-reference each other and are rarely used in isolation. They also reference DIT's own Approved Products List and DIT Test Procedures.

4. **SA-specific requirements:** The specifications contain SA-specific requirements that go beyond or differ from Austroads, including local material properties, climate considerations, and DIT-specific quality requirements.

## 7. Authority Terminology (Contract Administration)

### Primary Contract: SA GC21 Edition 2

SA DIT uses the **GC21 (General Conditions of Contract, Edition 2)** -- originally a NSW Government contract form that SA has adopted and modified for its own use. This is a significant departure from the AS-series contracts used by many other Australian states.

**Key terminology in SA DIT contracts:**

| Term | Description |
|------|------------|
| **Principal** | The Commissioner of Highways or Minister of Transport (i.e., the government client) |
| **Principal's Authorised Person** | The DIT representative who administers the contract on behalf of the Principal. This is the SA equivalent of a "Superintendent" in AS4000/AS2124 contracts. |
| **Contractor** | The party performing the works |

### Hold Points and Witness Points

Under the GC21 contract:
- The **Principal** may delegate authority for the release of **Hold Points** and **Witness Points**.
- The **Principal's Authorised Person** acts as an agent of the Principal (not as an independent certifier).
- GC21 expressly provides that the Principal's Authorised Person does **not** act as an independent certifier, valuer, or assessor (unlike the Superintendent role in AS4000).
- All acts of the Principal's Authorised Person are deemed to be acts of the Principal.

### Key Differences from Other States
- **SA does NOT use the term "Superintendent"** for civil infrastructure contracts (unlike VIC, QLD, and NSW which use AS4000 or similar with Superintendent roles).
- SA uses **"Principal's Authorised Person"** -- this is equivalent to the role that signs off hold points.
- For buildings projects, SA does use AS2124-1992 and AS4300-1995 with Special Conditions, which do include Superintendent roles.

### Contract Forms Summary

| Contract Type | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| **GC21 Terms and Conditions** | Medium to high-risk D&C and Construct-only civil projects |
| **MW21 (Minor Works 21)** | Low risk works or minor services related to infrastructure |
| **AS4122-2010 Special Conditions** | Professional Services |
| **Infrastructure Maintenance Services** | Medium to high-risk ongoing maintenance services |
| **Construction Goods & Services** | Supply-type contracts with DIT Special Conditions |
| **Alliance Agreement** | Alliance contracting (example templates provided) |
| **AS2124-1992 Special Conditions** | Buildings construct-only (NOT civil infrastructure) |
| **AS4300-1995 Special Conditions** | Buildings D&C (NOT civil infrastructure) |

## 8. SA-Specific Test Methods (TP Series)

### Yes, SA Has Its Own Test Method Series

SA DIT maintains its own **TP (Test Procedure)** series. These are SA-specific test methods maintained by DIT's Materials Technology group. The series ranges from **TP060 to TP999** and includes 99 documents total.

### Test Procedure Series Structure

| Series Range | Discipline |
|-------------|-----------|
| TP060 - TP099 | Analytical (statistical methods for testing) |
| TP100 - TP209 | Soils |
| TP210 - TP309 | Aggregates |
| TP310 - TP424 | Compaction / Field Testing |
| TP425 - TP499 | Asphalt |
| TP650 - TP749 | Bituminous |

### Key Test Procedures Referenced in Specifications

| TP Number | Title | Version |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| TP061 | Site Selection by Stratified Random Technique | v3.5 (Jul 2013) |
| TP065 | Determination of Uncertainty of Measurement | v1.7 (May 2012) |
| TP226 | Sampling of Soil, Aggregates and Rocks | v2.8 (May 2012) |

| TP652 | Determination of Viscosity by Haake Viscobalance | v3.13 (Nov 2014) |
| TP663 | Extraction of Binder from Spray Seals for Determination of Apparent Viscosity | v4.1 (May 2015) |

### Additional Documents

In addition to TPs, DIT also maintains:
- **Technical Notes** (TN016 - TN027): Guidelines and investigatory levels for specific topics (e.g., saline pavements, skid resistance, FWD testing)
- **Process Control Documents** (e.g., PC044 Approval and Registration of Asphalt Mix Designs)
- **Random Sampling Template** (Excel-based tool)

### Relationship to AS/NZS Standards
SA TP series supplements (not replaces) Australian Standards. Some TPs explicitly reference AS methods they modify or supplement (e.g., TP428 references AS 2891.2.2). The specifications also reference AS/NZS and Austroads test methods directly where appropriate.

## 9. Quality System -- Lot Definition

### Lot-Based Acceptance

SA DIT uses a **lot-based acceptance** system for quality testing, consistent with standard Australian practice but with SA-specific definitions.

### Lot Definition (from DIT specifications)

A **Lot** is defined as:
- A continuous section of the works having a **uniform appearance**
- Delivered using **homogeneous materials** and **consistent processes**
- Completed at the **same time**
- Limited to **no more than one day's production**

### Acceptance Process

1. **Acceptance is undertaken on a Lot basis** -- the total quantity of material in the Lot is subject to acceptance or rejection as a whole.
2. Material in a Lot is accepted if:
   - Material has been produced and stockpiled in accordance with the Specification
   - NATA-endorsed test results for the bulk sample comply with specified requirements
3. **Discrete result acceptance:** Where a test result fails, the stratum represented by that result must be the subject of a **Non-Conformance**.
4. **Testing frequency** is defined in specification tables based on Lot area (m2) and number of tests per layer (e.g., RD-PV-S2 Table 12-1).
5. **Random sampling** is governed by TP061 (Site Selection by Stratified Random Technique) and supported by the Random Sampling Template.

## 10. Recommended `stateSpec` Value for Database

### Recommendation: `'DIT'`

**Rationale:**
1. **DIT** is the current, official acronym used across the department's own documentation, website URL (dit.sa.gov.au), Master Specification headers, and email addresses (DIT.MasterSpecification@sa.gov.au).
2. While the social media accounts use "DFIT" or "DFITSA", the technical/standards documentation consistently uses "DIT".
3. "DPTI" is the legacy name (pre-August 2020) and should not be used for new implementations.
4. "SA_DIT" is unnecessarily verbose -- the state is identified elsewhere in the data model. All other states use the department acronym alone (e.g., 'VicRoads' for VIC, 'TMR' for QLD).

**Alternative consideration:** If the social media rebrand to "DFIT" becomes the official technical documentation standard in the future, this may need to be revisited. As of February 2026, "DIT" remains the standard in all specifications and contract documents.

## 11. Summary Comparison with Other States

| Feature | SA (DIT) | VIC (VicRoads/DoTP) | QLD (TMR) |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Spec Format** | RD-XX-YN (alphanumeric) | Section numbers (e.g., Section 306) | MRTS + number (e.g., MRTS05) |
| **Contract Form** | GC21 Edition 2 | AS4000 (with supplements) | MRTS/AS-based |
| **Hold Point Authority** | Principal's Authorised Person | Superintendent | Administrator/Superintendent |
| **Own Test Methods** | Yes (TP series, TP060-TP999) | Yes (RC series) | Yes (Q series) |
| **Relationship to Austroads** | Standalone specs referencing Austroads | Supplements to Austroads | Standalone with MRTS series |
| **Lot Definition** | Uniform section, one day's production, homogeneous | Per specification section | Per MRTS section |
| **Department Acronym** | DIT | DoTP (formerly VicRoads) | TMR |
| **Recommended stateSpec** | `'DIT'` | `'VicRoads'` | `'TMR'` |

## 12. Key Observations for ITP Template Development

1. **Numbering system is different:** SA uses `RD-EW-C1` style codes, not "Part R15" or "Section 306". ITP templates need to reference the correct spec numbers.

2. **Contract terminology is unique:** SA uses "Principal's Authorised Person" for hold point sign-off, not "Superintendent". ITP templates and hold point descriptions must use the correct SA terminology.

3. **GC21 contract is unusual in Australia:** Most other states use AS-series contracts. The GC21 has a different hold point/witness point framework that should be reflected in template language.

4. **Test methods are SA-specific:** The TP series must be referenced correctly alongside AS/NZS standards. The TP number should be included in ITP test method fields.

5. **Comprehensive spec system:** With 130+ specification parts across 9 categories, SA has one of the most granular specification systems in Australia. ITP templates should cross-reference the specific spec part relevant to each inspection activity.

6. **The PC-QA1A/B specs are critical:** These define the quality management framework including hold point, witness point, and lot acceptance processes. They should be the primary reference for ITP structure.

7. **Approved Products List:** DIT maintains a specific Approved Products list that may need to be referenced in material-related hold points.
