## Specification Mapping (Corrected from Initial Brief)

The initial brief assumed separate MRTS numbers for each barrier type. Research confirms the following correct mapping:

| Template | Correct Spec | Title | Edition |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------|
| 17: Steel Wire Rope Barrier | MRTS14 | Road Furniture | July 2024 [VERIFY] |
| 18: W-Beam Guard Fence | MRTS14 | Road Furniture | July 2024 [VERIFY] |
| 19: Concrete Barrier | MRTS14 | Road Furniture | July 2024 [VERIFY] |
| 20: Pavement Marking | MRTS45 | Road Surface Delineation (harmonised with ATS 4110) | November 2025 [VERIFY] |
| 21: Fencing | MRTS14 (fencing) + MRTS15 (noise fences) | Road Furniture / Noise Fences | MRTS14: July 2024 / MRTS15: November 2025 [VERIFY] |

**Key Finding:** MRTS14 "Road Furniture" is the single TMR specification covering road signs, grids, steel beam guardrail, tensioned wire rope barrier systems, steel traffic barriers, concrete traffic barriers, road edge guide posts, fencing and gates. MRTS15 covers noise fences specifically. MRTS45 covers road surface delineation (pavement markings, raised pavement markers, ATLM).

### TMR Accepted Road Safety Barrier Systems (December 2025)

TMR maintains a register of accepted road safety barrier systems tested to MASH (Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware). Key points:
- Minimum performance level for permanent installations: MASH Test Level 3 (TL-3)
- All barrier systems must be from TMR's accepted list
- Public domain steel barriers are being phased out for new projects; public domain concrete barriers remain accepted
- Proprietary systems require manufacturer's installation manual compliance
- Austroads Technical Conditions of Use (TCU) replace TMR product datasheets
