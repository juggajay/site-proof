## Notes & Caveats

1. **[VERIFY] Tags:** Items tagged with [VERIFY] indicate clause numbers or specific values that could not be confirmed against the current edition of the specification due to restricted PDF access. These should be verified against the official TMR specification documents before use in production.

2. **Specification Access:** TMR MRTS specifications are published at https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/business-industry/Technical-standards-publications/Specifications. Current editions should be downloaded and clause numbers confirmed.

3. **Annexure Requirements:** Many TMR specifications have project-specific Annexure documents (e.g., Annexure MRTS52.1, Annexure MRTS16.1) that modify or supplement the base specification. ITPs should be reviewed against project-specific annexures.

4. **MRTS16 Not MRTS34:** The research brief referenced MRTS34 for landscaping -- this spec number does not exist in TMR's current index. The correct specification is **MRTS16 Landscape and Revegetation Works**.

5. **MRTS06 Title Change:** Formerly "Reinforced Soil Structures", now "Reinforced Soil Walls" as of March 2023 edition.

6. **MRTS58 Category:** MRTS58 (Geosynthetics for Subgrade and Pavement Reinforcement) is under Category 5 (Pavements, Subgrade and Surfacing), not Category 3.

7. **Environmental Legislation:** All templates should cross-reference the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld), Environmental Protection Regulation 2019, and State Planning Policy 2017 for environmental compliance requirements.

8. **QLD Water Quality Release Criteria:** TSS <= 50mg/L, pH 6.5-8.5, field turbidity < 60 NTU screening threshold. These are statewide standards per DES Procedural Guide.

9. **IECA Manual:** The IECA Best Practice Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (2008 as amended) is the prescribed design standard referenced by MRTS52 for ESC device design.

10. **Administrator Terminology:** All templates use "Administrator" per QLD TMR contract conditions. This is equivalent to "Superintendent" in other Australian state contract systems.
