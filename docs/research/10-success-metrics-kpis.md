# SiteProof Launch Success Metrics & KPI Framework

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Market:** Australian civil construction quality management
**Product:** SiteProof v3 -- SaaS platform for lots, ITPs, hold points, NCRs, daily diaries, dockets, progress claims, and documents

---

## Executive Summary

SiteProof is entering the AU$166B Australian construction market at a time when digital adoption is accelerating -- the average construction business now uses 6.2 technologies (up 20% YoY), and each additional technology adopted correlates with a 1.14% revenue uplift. The global construction SaaS market is projected to grow at 10.8% CAGR to USD $45.5B by 2035, providing strong tailwinds.

**Key findings from this research:**

1. **Launch targets are realistic but aggressive.** Reaching 50+ paying companies in Year 1 is achievable for a well-executed vertical SaaS in a defined niche, but requires a dedicated sales motion from Day 1 and a clear differentiation strategy against incumbents like Procore, Aconex, and HammerTech.

2. **Unit economics favour the model.** With an estimated ARPA (Average Revenue Per Account) of $6,000--$12,000/year for civil contractors with 10--50 users, and B2B SaaS CAC benchmarks of $1,500--$5,000, a 3:1+ LTV:CAC ratio is achievable within 18 months.

3. **Churn is the critical risk.** SMB-focused construction SaaS faces 3--5% monthly logo churn in early stages. Reducing this below 2% monthly by Month 6 is essential for hitting Year 1 ARR targets. Net Revenue Retention must exceed 100% by Month 9.

4. **Engagement, not just acquisition, determines survival.** The activation metric -- getting a company to create their first lot, complete their first ITP, and generate their first progress claim within 14 days -- will be the strongest leading indicator of retention.

5. **The $300K--$500K Year 1 ARR target maps to 35--55 companies at mid-range ARPA.** This is ambitious for a bootstrapped/early-stage company but within range if sales execution is strong and product-market fit is validated in the first 90 days.

**Recommended focus areas:** (1) Nail onboarding time-to-value under 7 days, (2) Build referral/word-of-mouth engine in AU civil contractor networks, (3) Track weekly active users at the account level, not just signups.

## 2. Validated 12-Month Targets

### Customer Acquisition Targets

| Period | Target Companies | Cumulative | Monthly Net New | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Month 1 | 2--3 | 2--3 | 2--3 | Founder-led sales to existing network; beta users converting |
| Month 2 | 2--3 | 4--6 | 2--3 | Referrals from Month 1; continued outreach |
| Month 3 | 2--4 | 6--10 | 2--4 | Word of mouth starts; first case studies |
| Month 4--6 | 3--5/mo | 15--25 | 3--5 | Repeatable sales process; content marketing |
| Month 7--9 | 5--8/mo | 30--45 | 5--8 | Scaled outbound; partnerships with industry bodies |
| Month 10--12 | 5--10/mo | 45--65 | 5--10 | Channel partners; inbound pipeline matures |

**Assessment: REALISTIC WITH CONDITIONS**

- The 5--10 companies in Month 1--3 is achievable if SiteProof has an existing network of civil contractors from beta/pilot phases. Without pre-existing relationships, expect 3--5 companies.
- The 15--30 companies by Month 6 requires a working sales playbook and at least one full-time person dedicated to sales/customer success.
- The 50+ companies by Month 12 is aggressive but achievable. For comparison:
  - SafetyCulture (Australia) grew methodically from a niche safety inspection tool, reaching thousands of customers over several years, but they had VC backing.
  - HammerTech reached 85% of Australia's top 100 contractors but over a 10-year period with $105M in funding.
  - For a bootstrapped/seed-stage company, 30--50 paying companies in Year 1 is a strong result; 50--65 would be exceptional.

### Revenue Targets

| Period | MRR Range | ARR Run Rate | Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Month 3 | $5K--$10K | $60K--$120K | 6--10 companies at $750--$1,000 avg MRR |
| Month 6 | $15K--$30K | $180K--$360K | 15--25 companies; some upselling |
| Month 9 | $22K--$38K | $264K--$456K | 30--40 companies; improved ARPA |
| Month 12 | $28K--$45K | $336K--$540K | 45--65 companies; expansion revenue |

**Assessment of $300K--$500K Year 1 ARR:**

- **$300K ARR** = $25K MRR = achievable with ~35 companies at ~$714 MRR ($8,571/year ARPA)
- **$500K ARR** = $41.7K MRR = requires ~55 companies at ~$758 MRR ($9,091/year ARPA)
- **Verdict:** The lower end ($300K) is achievable with strong execution. The upper end ($500K) requires either more customers than projected OR higher ARPA through multi-module pricing. Comparable vertical SaaS startups typically reach $200K--$400K ARR in Year 1 with dedicated sales effort.

### Comparable Company Benchmarks

| Company | Segment | Year 1 Approximate ARR | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| Procore | Construction (US) | <$1M (early years) | Founded 2002, slow early growth; ARR exploded post-2014 |
| PlanGrid | Construction (US) | ~$1M--$5M | Fast PLG adoption; acquired by Autodesk for $875M |
| SafetyCulture | Safety/Quality (AU) | Modest early revenue | $6.1M Series A in 2014; now valued at $2.7B |
| HammerTech | Safety/Compliance (AU) | Not disclosed | 10 years to reach market dominance in AU |
| Typical Vertical SaaS | Various | $200K--$500K | Seed-stage with founder-led sales |

## 3. Unit Economics Model

### Revenue Model Assumptions

| Parameter | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **ARPA (Annual Revenue Per Account)** | $6,000/yr ($500/mo) | $9,000/yr ($750/mo) | $12,000/yr ($1,000/mo) |
| **Pricing basis** | Per-project or per-company | Tiered by users + modules | Per-user + modules |
| **Avg users per account** | 10 | 20 | 35 |
| **Effective per-user price** | $50/user/mo | $37.50/user/mo | $28.57/user/mo |

**ARPA Rationale:** Procore charges $4,500--$60,000/year depending on company size and modules. For AU civil contractors (typically 10--50 users), a $6,000--$12,000 annual price point is competitive while leaving room for expansion. Aconex charges $100--500+/user/year. SiteProof's quality-management focus justifies premium pricing vs. generic tools.

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

| Channel | Est. CAC | Conversion Rate | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Founder-led sales (network) | $500--$1,000 | 30--40% | Highest ROI in Year 1 |
| Inbound (content/SEO) | $1,500--$2,500 | 15--20% | 6--12 month ramp |
| Outbound (cold outreach) | $2,500--$4,000 | 5--10% | Cold calling AU contractors |
| Industry events/trade shows | $3,000--$5,000 | 10--15% | High trust channel for construction |
| Referrals/word-of-mouth | $300--$800 | 25--35% | Build referral program early |
| **Blended CAC (Year 1)** | **$1,500--$3,000** | **15--25%** | **Weighted toward founder-led** |

### LTV Calculation

| Scenario | Monthly Churn | Avg Lifetime | ARPA | LTV | LTV:CAC |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------|-----|---------|
| Conservative | 4% | 25 months | $500/mo | $12,500 | 4.2:1 |
| Base Case | 2.5% | 40 months | $750/mo | $30,000 | 10:1 |
| Optimistic | 1.5% | 67 months | $1,000/mo | $67,000 | 22:1 |

**LTV Formula:** ARPA / Monthly Churn Rate

### Payback Period

| Scenario | Blended CAC | Monthly Gross Margin (80%) | Payback |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Conservative | $3,000 | $400 | 7.5 months |
| Base Case | $2,250 | $600 | 3.75 months |
| Optimistic | $1,500 | $800 | 1.9 months |

**Target:** CAC payback under 12 months. Even the conservative scenario achieves this, which is a strong signal for the business model. The B2B SaaS median payback is 8.6 months.

### Year 1 Financial Summary (Base Case)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Customers (end of Year 1) | 50 |
| Avg Customers (for revenue calc) | ~28 |
| ARPA | $9,000/year |
| Gross MRR at Month 12 | $37,500 |
| Total Revenue (Year 1) | ~$250K--$350K |
| ARR Run Rate (end of Year 1) | ~$450K |
| Total S&M Spend | ~$100K--$150K |
| Blended CAC | $2,000--$3,000 |
| Gross Margin | ~80% |
| CAC Payback | 3--8 months |

## 4. Engagement Metric Definitions & Targets

### Activation Events (The Critical Path)

Activation is the single strongest predictor of retention. SiteProof should define a clear activation sequence and track completion rates for each step.

| Step | Activation Event | Target Completion | Timeframe | Why It Matters |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Account created + first user invited** | 95% | Day 0 | Basic onboarding entry |
| 2 | **First project created** | 85% | Day 1 | Demonstrates intent to use |
| 3 | **First lot created** | 70% | Day 3 | Core workflow initiated |
| 4 | **First ITP assigned to lot** | 60% | Day 5 | Quality management activated |
| 5 | **First hold point completed** | 50% | Day 7 | Field workflow validated |
| 6 | **First daily diary entry** | 45% | Day 7 | Daily usage pattern established |
| 7 | **First progress claim generated** | 35% | Day 14 | Commercial value demonstrated |
| 8 | **Second user active on same account** | 40% | Day 7 | Team adoption (critical for retention) |

**Primary Activation Metric:** Account reaches Step 5 (first hold point completed) within 7 days.
**Target:** 50% of new accounts activate within 7 days.

### Engagement Tiers

Define account health based on usage patterns:

| Tier | Definition | Target % of Accounts | Action |
|------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Power User** | 5+ active users, daily logins, 3+ features used weekly | 20% | Upsell; collect testimonials |
| **Healthy** | 3+ active users, 3+ logins/week, 2+ features used weekly | 40% | Maintain; encourage expansion |
| **At Risk** | 1--2 active users, 1--2 logins/week, 1 feature used | 25% | Proactive outreach; training |
| **Dormant** | No login in 7+ days | <15% | Immediate intervention; rescue |

### Feature Adoption Targets (Month 6)

Track the percentage of active accounts using each core module at least once per month:

| Feature | Month 3 Target | Month 6 Target | Month 12 Target | Priority |
|---------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Lot Management** | 90% | 95% | 95% | Core -- must-use |
| **ITP Completion** | 70% | 80% | 85% | Core -- primary differentiator |
| **Hold Point Sign-offs** | 55% | 70% | 80% | Core -- field workflow |
| **Daily Diary** | 40% | 55% | 65% | Engagement driver |
| **NCR Management** | 25% | 40% | 55% | Value-add |
| **Docket Management** | 30% | 45% | 60% | Commercial |
| **Progress Claims** | 20% | 35% | 50% | High-value; expansion trigger |
| **Document Management** | 50% | 65% | 75% | Stickiness driver |

### Time-to-Value Benchmarks

| Milestone | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Time to First Value (TTFV)** | <1 day | Account created to first lot created |
| **Time to Core Value (TTCV)** | <7 days | Account created to first ITP completed on a lot |
| **Time to Full Value (TTFV)** | <30 days | Account created to first progress claim generated |
| **Time to Team Adoption** | <14 days | Account created to 3+ users active |

### Weekly Engagement Scorecard

Track these weekly at the account level:

| Metric | Healthy | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Active Users (% of seats)** | >60% | 30--60% | <30% |
| **Sessions per User per Week** | >3 | 1--3 | <1 |
| **Core Actions per Week** | >10 | 3--10 | <3 |
| **Documents Uploaded (weekly)** | >5 | 1--5 | 0 |
| **Days Since Last Login (any user)** | 0--1 | 2--5 | >5 |

## 5. Competitive Benchmarking Context

### AU Construction Software Landscape

| Competitor | Focus | Pricing | Strengths | SiteProof Differentiation |
|-----------|-------|---------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Procore** | Full PM suite | $10K--$60K+/yr | Market leader; broad features | Niche focus on quality/ITP; lower price point; AU civil-specific |
| **Aconex (Oracle)** | Document mgmt | $100--500+/user/yr | Enterprise trust; infrastructure focus | Modern UX; faster onboarding; built for field workers |
| **HammerTech** | Safety/compliance | Custom pricing | 85% of AU top 100; safety-focused | Quality management vs. safety; complementary positioning |
| **SafetyCulture** | Inspections/audits | Freemium + enterprise | AU unicorn; mobile-first | Deeper construction quality workflow; ITP/hold point specialisation |
| **InEight** | Cost/schedule | Enterprise pricing | Strong in infrastructure | Quality focus vs. cost focus; simpler for mid-market |
| **Assignar** | Equipment/workforce | Mid-market pricing | AU-based; field operations | Quality management vs. resource management |

### Positioning Advantage

SiteProof occupies a specific niche: **quality management for AU civil contractors** (lots, ITPs, hold points, NCRs). Most competitors are either:
- Too broad (Procore, Aconex) and expensive for mid-market civil contractors
- Too focused on safety (HammerTech, SafetyCulture) rather than quality compliance
- Too focused on cost/schedule (InEight) rather than quality workflows

This niche positioning should yield:
- Higher demo-to-paid conversion (15--25%) due to specific fit
- Lower churn (strong workflow lock-in once ITPs are configured)
- Higher NPS from civil contractors who feel underserved by generic tools

## 6. Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Slow sales cycle** (construction buyers are conservative) | High | High | Build trust with free trials; case studies from early adopters; industry body partnerships |
| **High early churn** (poor onboarding) | Medium | High | White-glove onboarding for first 20 customers; dedicated CSM |
| **Low field adoption** (workers resist new tools) | Medium | High | Mobile-first UX; offline capability; minimal training required |
| **Competitor response** (Procore or SafetyCulture adds quality module) | Medium | Medium | Move fast; deep AU civil expertise; build switching costs |
| **Seasonal demand** (construction cycles) | Medium | Low | Plan launches around project start seasons (Feb--Apr, Aug--Oct in AU) |
| **Price sensitivity** (civil contractors margin-conscious) | Medium | Medium | ROI calculator; usage-based pricing tier; demonstrate cost savings |
