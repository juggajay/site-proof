# SiteProof v3 — Launch Research Summary

> Consolidated summary of 10 research documents covering competitive landscape, market sizing, buyer journey, pricing, regulatory compliance, integrations, onboarding, risks, launch channels, and success metrics.

## Overarching Sentiment: **Strongly Optimistic with Clear Execution Requirements**

SiteProof targets a large, underserved market of 1,800–2,400 mid-market Australian civil contractors who mostly still run paper/Excel-based quality systems. The competitive landscape is fragmented — no one platform combines lot-based ITP management, state authority spec compliance, evidence-backed progress claims, and mobile-first field capability at accessible pricing. Regulatory tailwinds (digital mandates, SOPA reforms, ISO requirements) are creating urgency. The product is feature-complete but needs 3–4 weeks of operational readiness work (legal docs, bundle optimization, support infrastructure) before launch.

---

## 1. Competitive Landscape

**Sentiment: Optimistic**

The market splits into three tiers: enterprise platforms (Procore at $10K–$60K+/yr, Aconex), general field tools (Fieldwire, SafetyCulture at $24/user/mo), and niche AU tools (CivilPro at ~$10K/yr, CONQA). No competitor natively combines AU civil ITP workflows + state spec compliance + progress claims + mobile-first UX at mid-market pricing. CivilPro is the closest incumbent but is desktop-first with $250/hr setup fees — a clear switching opportunity.

**SiteProof's defensible position:** AU civil-native ITPs, evidence-backed claims, accessible pricing ($2K–$10K/yr target).

---

## 2. Market Sizing

**Sentiment: Optimistic**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TAM (all AU construction quality software) | $720M–$960M/yr |
| SAM (mid-market civil contractors) | $108M–$180M |
| Target segment | 2,400–3,200 contractors ($5M–$100M revenue) |
| Greenfield opportunity | 65–75% lack purpose-built QMS |
| Year 1 revenue target | $540K–$1.08M (30–60 customers) |
| Year 3 scale target | $3.6M–$7.2M |
| Infrastructure pipeline | $120B+ federal commitment over 10 years |
| Construction software CAGR (AU) | 11.8% |

Structural tailwinds: massive infrastructure spending, regulatory mandates for digital quality records, and low current digital penetration (31.9% adoption).

---

## 3. Buyer Journey & Sales

**Sentiment: Cautious/Realistic**

The typical buyer is an owner-operator (10–50 employees) or quality manager champion driven by rework costs eating 5–12% of contract value. Sales cycles run 30–90 days with 50–70% pilot-to-paid conversion when an internal champion exists (3x higher close rates). 48% cite training costs as the top adoption barrier.

**Key insight:** Deals without identified internal champions stall significantly. Founder-led sales is most efficient in Year 1 ($500–$1,000 CAC vs $1,500–$3,000 blended).

---

## 4. Pricing Strategy

**Sentiment: Optimistic**

SiteProof delivers $48K–$2.4M in annual value per contractor, supporting $39–69 AUD/user/month across three tiers. This fills the gap between generic tools ($25–39/user/mo) and enterprise platforms ($375+/mo). Free subcontractor access is a proven growth lever (HammerTech, PlanRadar model). ROI of 10–56x at proposed pricing. Target ACV: $5,880–$14,700 per customer (10–25 paid users).

**Key insight:** 14-day trials outperform 30-day by 71%. Target 15–25% trial conversion.

---

## 5. Regulatory Compliance

**Sentiment: Cautious but Opportunistic**

All states require ISO 9001 certification. NSW requires digital submission via Principal's EDMS. Queensland removed barriers to digital service delivery (Nov 2025). Victoria's SOPA changes extend claim windows (Sept 2026). Data residency on Australian servers is non-negotiable (Privacy Act amendments carry up to $50M penalties).

**Must-do:** Verify Sydney-region data residency, pursue ISO 27001 certification ($30K–$80K, 12–18 months). The 12–18 month window to establish position before competitors capitalize is critical.

---

## 6. Integration Ecosystem

**Sentiment: Optimistic**

AU contractors use an average 6.9 software tools. Fragmentation is the #1 adoption barrier.

| Priority | Integration | Impact | Timeline |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| P0 | Excel/CSV import + PDF export | 10/10 | Weeks 2–4 |
| P0 | Xero (60% AU accounting market) | 9/10 | Weeks 4–6 |
| P1 | Procore (313+ AU customers) | 9/10 | Weeks 6–10 |
| P2 | SharePoint/M365, SafetyCulture | Medium | Phase 2 |

Procore marketplace distribution is a proven channel. SiteProof positions as integration hub for quality data, not a Procore replacement.

---

## 7. Onboarding & Implementation

**Sentiment: Optimistic**

75% of users abandon a product in the first week if they struggle. Well-onboarded civil customers are 5x more likely to stay past day 90. Target: first project live within 5 business days, full capability by day 30.

**The single biggest adoption driver:** 15–25 pre-built ITP templates per state authority (TfNSW Q6, TMR MRTS, VicRoads). Foreman training must be under 5 minutes per topic, mobile-first. Competitors charge $150–$500/user for implementation — SiteProof's guided self-service is a differentiator.

---

## 8. Risks & Blockers

**Sentiment: Cautious but Actionable**

22 risks identified, 5 critical. All have documented mitigation paths. **3–4 weeks to address launch blockers:**

| Blocker | Impact | Effort |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Bundle size (3.46MB, 15–30s on 3G) | Launch blocker | 7–8 days frontend work |
| Missing legal framework (TOS, Privacy, PI insurance) | Launch blocker | $3K–$8K legal + $2K–$5K/yr PI |
| No support infrastructure | Launch blocker | Define before 50 users |
| iOS Safari IndexedDB eviction | Silent data loss | Mitigation needed |
| N+1 query degradation | Invisible until 50+ projects (5–10x slowdown) | Pre-launch optimization |

---

## 9. Launch Channel Strategy

**Sentiment: Optimistic**

**90-day budget:** $25K–$35K AUD. **Expected outcomes:** 150–250 qualified leads, 15–30 trial signups, 5–10 paying customers.

| Channel | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| CCF (Civil Contractors Federation) | Critical | 1,800 members = exact target audience |
| Niche SEO ("ITP software", "hold point software") | High | Very low competition, high intent |
| LinkedIn Ads | High | $80–150 CPL, better targeting than Google |
| CCF Earth Awards / Roads Australia Summit | High | $2K–$20K per event |
| Testing lab referral partnerships | High | Construction Sciences, Aitken Rowe, THN Group |
| Content marketing (12 blog posts) | Medium | 500–1,500 organic visits/mo by Month 3 |

---

## 10. Success Metrics & KPIs

**Sentiment: Optimistic with Realistic Caveats**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Year 1 ARR | $300K–$500K |
| Year 1 paying companies | 50+ |
| ARPA | ~$9,000/company |
| Month 3 milestone | 5–10 companies, $60K–$120K ARR |
| CAC payback | 3–8 months (B2B SaaS median: 8.6) |
| LTV:CAC ratio | 3:1+ within 18 months |
| Monthly logo churn | <5% M3, <3% M6, <2% M12 |
| NPS | >40 (construction SaaS baseline: 37) |
| Activation | 50% complete first hold point within 7 days |
| Time-to-value | <1 day first value, <7 days core value |

**$300K ARR is achievable with strong execution; $500K is ambitious** requiring either more customers or higher ARPA.

## Top 5 Themes Across All Research

1. **Activation beats acquisition** — Time-to-first-value (<7 days) is the strongest predictor of retention. Pre-built ITP templates are the single biggest lever.

2. **The market window is 12–18 months** — Regulatory tailwinds (digital mandates, SOPA reforms) are creating urgency, but competitors will catch up. First-mover advantage in AU civil-specific QMS is real but time-limited.

3. **Founder-led sales + champions = Year 1 engine** — Lowest CAC ($500–$1K), highest close rates (3x with champion). CCF events and testing lab partnerships are the highest-ROI channels.

4. **Operational readiness is the actual launch blocker** — The product works. What's missing is legal docs, bundle optimization, support infrastructure, and data residency verification. 3–4 weeks of focused work.

5. **Pricing is defensible and the value gap is massive** — $39–69/user/month delivers 10–56x ROI for contractors losing 5–12% of contract value to rework. Free subcontractor access creates network effects.
