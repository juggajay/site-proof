# SiteProof Launch Channel Strategy
## Go-to-Market Plan for Australian Civil Contractors (10-200 Employees)

**Prepared:** February 2026
**Target Market:** Australian civil contractors (roads, bridges, earthworks) with 10-200 employees
**Product:** SiteProof - Construction Quality Management Platform (ITPs, hold points, NCRs, daily diaries, dockets, progress claims, documents)

---

## Executive Summary

SiteProof enters the Australian civil construction quality management market at an opportune time. The $122.4 billion heavy and civil engineering construction sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, with the average construction business now using 6.2 technologies (up 20% year-over-year) and reporting that digital QA tools deliver 50% faster project starts and 50% fewer defects. The incumbent, CivilPro, has dominated the lot-based QA space for over a decade but faces growing competition from broader platforms like Procore, Sitemate, and FTQ360.

**Key Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Lead with SEO and content marketing** targeting high-intent, low-competition keywords like "ITP software Australia," "hold point management software," and "NCR tracking construction." These niche terms have minimal paid competition despite strong buyer intent.

2. **Invest in LinkedIn Ads over Google Ads** for the first 90 days, targeting quality managers, project managers, and site managers at civil contractors with 11-200 employees. Expected CPL of $80-150 AUD is justified by the high LTV of SaaS subscriptions.

3. **Pursue CCF state branch sponsorships** as the primary industry channel. The CCF's 1,800 members represent the exact target audience. State-level sponsorship is affordable and provides credibility that digital channels cannot.

4. **Build a content moat** around free ITP templates, state authority compliance guides, and practical "how-to" content. Competitors like Sitemate already use this strategy effectively; SiteProof must match and exceed their template library.

5. **Establish testing laboratory referral partnerships** with NATA-accredited labs (Construction Sciences, Aitken Rowe, THN Group) who interact daily with quality managers on civil projects.

**90-Day Budget:** $25,000-$35,000 AUD
**Expected Outcomes:** 150-250 qualified leads, 15-30 trial signups, 5-10 paying customers

## 1. Market Context

### 1.1 Industry Size and Opportunity

The Australian construction industry comprises approximately 452,820 active companies and employs around 1.26 million people as of 2025. The heavy and civil engineering construction subsector is valued at $122.4 billion. Major infrastructure investment continues to drive demand, with almost $19 billion in pipeline project spending in Q1 2025 alone.

The target segment (civil contractors, 10-200 employees, roads/bridges/earthworks) is estimated at 3,000-5,000 firms nationally, based on ABS data showing construction businesses by employment size and the proportion focused on civil works.

### 1.2 Digital Adoption in Construction

According to the Deloitte/Visibuild "State of Digital Adoption in the Construction Industry 2025" report:

- The average construction business has adopted **6.2 technologies**, up 20% from 5.3 the prior year
- Businesses use a median of **11 different data environments** to manage project data
- Moving to a more uniform data environment would save approximately **10.5 hours per week**
- Each additional technology adopted is associated with a **1.14% increase in expected revenue**
- **48% cite training costs** and **45% cite operational costs** as barriers to adoption
- Australian builders report **50% faster starts** and **50% fewer defects** using digital quality platforms

### 1.3 Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| **CivilPro** | Industry standard for lot-based QA, 10+ years in AU market | Annual plan, custom pricing for 50+ seats | Deep ITP/hold point features, brand recognition, AU-specific | Legacy product, limited modern UX |
| **Procore** | Enterprise all-in-one construction management | Custom (premium pricing) | Brand, integrations, comprehensive | Expensive, overkill for SMB civil |
| **Sitemate (Dashpivot)** | No-code field data capture | ~$39 AUD/user/month | Templates, ease of use, content marketing | Generic, not civil-specific |
| **FTQ360** | Quality management and inspections | From $249 USD/month | Quality-focused, real-time reporting | US-centric, limited AU presence |
| **BuildPass** | AI-powered compliance | Custom | AI features, AU market | Newer entrant, broad focus |

**SiteProof's differentiation:** Purpose-built for civil construction QA with integrated lot management, ITPs, hold points, NCRs, daily diaries, dockets, and progress claims in a single modern platform. Designed specifically for the 10-200 employee civil contractor segment that is underserved by both CivilPro (aging interface) and Procore (enterprise pricing).

| Factor | Google Ads | LinkedIn Ads |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Intent level | High (searching for solution) | Low (interruption-based) |
| Targeting precision | Keyword-based | Job title + company size + industry |
| CPC | $2-6 AUD | $8-15 AUD |
| CPL | $50-100 AUD | $80-150 AUD |
| Volume | Limited (niche keywords) | Higher (broader reach) |

### 4.2 Testing Laboratory Referral Partnerships

Testing laboratories interact daily with quality managers on civil construction sites. They are natural referral partners because:
- They receive test requests that are currently managed on paper or in spreadsheets
- They see the pain of disorganised quality management firsthand
- Their relationship with site teams is trusted and non-competitive

**Target Partners:**

| Laboratory | Coverage | Specialisation | Referral Potential |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Construction Sciences** | National | Construction materials testing (CMT) | High - principal CMT provider, NATA accredited |
| **Aitken Rowe (ARTL)** | National | Soil, aggregate, concrete testing (130+ test types) | High - deep civil focus |
| **THN Group** | NSW, QLD | Full NATA accreditation, laboratory testing | Medium-High |
| **Douglas Partners** | National | Geotechnical, environmental | Medium |
| **Cardno (now Stantec)** | National | Testing, engineering | Medium |

**Partnership Structure:**
- **Referral fee:** 10-15% of first-year subscription value for qualified referrals
- **Co-branding:** "Recommended by [Lab Name]" badge on SiteProof site
- **Integration:** API connection for test result import (future roadmap feature)
- **Joint marketing:** Co-authored content on "Streamlining Test Request Management"

### 4.3 Engineering Consultancy Partnerships

Engineering consultancies (design and superintendent roles) regularly specify quality management requirements for civil projects. Their recommendation carries significant weight.

**Target Partners:**

| Consultancy | Relevance | Approach |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **GHD** | Major infrastructure consultancy, AU headquartered | Superintendent teams, innovation team |
| **WSP** | Global with strong AU presence | Digital construction team |
| **Aurecon** | AU/NZ headquartered, infrastructure focus | Digital advisory practice |
| **SMEC** | Civil infrastructure specialist | Project superintendent roles |
| **Cardno/Stantec** | Testing + consulting | Quality management recommendations |

**Approach:** Target superintendent teams and innovation/digital advisory groups. Offer a "Superintendent Dashboard" feature that provides consultancy partners with read-only oversight of contractor quality records. This creates a compelling reason for them to recommend SiteProof to their contractor clients.

### 4.4 State Authority Innovation Teams

State road authorities (TMR, Transport NSW, MRWA, VicRoads/DoT, DPTI) increasingly require digital quality records and are open to innovation partnerships.

| Authority | State | Digital Maturity | Opportunity |
|-----------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Transport for NSW** | NSW | High | Standards portal, innovation partnerships |
| **TMR (Dept of Transport and Main Roads)** | QLD | High | Specifications compliance, digital ITP |
| **DoT Victoria** | VIC | Medium-High | Major Projects Authority innovation |
| **Main Roads WA** | WA | Medium | Digital innovation in road construction |
| **DPTI South Australia** | SA | Medium | Infrastructure investment pipeline |

**Approach:**
1. Map SiteProof features to each state authority's QA specification requirements
2. Create state-specific compliance guides (e.g., "How SiteProof Meets TMR MRTS Requirements")
3. Apply for innovation partnership or supplier panel inclusion
4. Present at authority-hosted industry days

### 4.5 Technology Partner Co-Marketing

| Partner | Relationship | Co-Marketing Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Supabase** | Infrastructure provider | Case study on Supabase's site, "Built with Supabase" badge |
| **Procore Marketplace** | Integration partner | List on Procore App Marketplace for overlay positioning |
| **Xero/MYOB** | Accounting integration | Docket and progress claim data flow, joint content |
| **SafetyCulture (iAuditor)** | Complementary product | Cross-promotion to overlapping audience |
| **Position Partners/Aptella** | Survey/GPS tech | Co-marketing at construction events |
