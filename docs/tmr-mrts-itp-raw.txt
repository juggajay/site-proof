Rapid) -   Degree of Saturation (Moisture)   – Moisture content of compacted layer | TMR Q250 (calculation of DoS) -   Ball   Penetration   (deflection)   –   In-situ   stiffness   (for   proof   roll)   |   Austroads   AG:PT/T251   (Ball Penetration Test)  Acceptance Criteria (Unbound Pavements):  -   Compaction:   100%   Modified   Proctor   MDD   for   all   High-Standard   Base   materials   (Type   1   HSG, subclasses 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2)   . Other unbound materials (lower traffic classes) must be compacted to   100%   Standard   Proctor   MDD   .   Each   lot’s   characteristic   in-situ   density   must   meet   these minimums (i.e. mean density sufficiently above target to ensure > 95% confidence)   . -   Moisture (Degree of Saturation):   During compaction, maintain material at   ≤   70–80%   Degree of Saturation (DoS) unless otherwise approved   . (For example,   < 70% DoS   typically to avoid saturation of Type 1 base.) If DoS exceeds limit (i.e. material too wet), drying or blending is required before compaction. -   Layer Thickness & Level:   Achieve the design layer thickness within tolerance – usually no negative tolerance (no under-thickness) and +10 mm allowable. Finished base course level ±10 mm, subbase ±15 mm from design   . Overall pavement thickness must meet or exceed design (no cumulative deficit). -   Surface Shape:   Base course surface must not deviate > 5 mm under a 3 m straightedge (smoothness for   asphalt)   and   have   correct   crossfall.   Subbase   straightedge   tolerance   10   mm.   No   potholes, segregation, or loose stone on surface. -   Strength (Soaked CBR):   Where a soaked CBR requirement is specified (e.g. Type 2 subbase   ≥   80), the material must meet that value in laboratory testing   . (Type 2 material typically   ≥   80% CBR; Type 3   ≥   60%.) Materials compacted to 100% modified usually don’t require routine CBR testing . -   Aggregate Quality:   Material must comply with grading envelope and durability limits (e.g. PI, Los Angeles loss) as per spec. Wet/dry strength variation   ≤   35% and LA Abrasion   ≤   35 (for Type 1).   No oversize rock   above max size. Material failing to meet any critical quality criteria is rejected   .  Test Frequencies (Unbound Pavements):  -   Source Material Testing:   At least one   batch   of tests per material source   before   placement (per Table A. 1) – e.g.   1 Grading & PI per 1000 t   (or 250 m³) of produced aggregate,   1 CBR   (soaked) per 5,000 t (if required for Type 2/3)   . Quarry certification tests (LA Abrasion, etc.) per Quarry Registration Scheme (usually quarterly or per 10,000 t). -   Lot Compaction Testing: Minimum 1 density test per Lot   of compacted layer, where Lot ~   2000 m²  for base (each layer)   . In practice, a test roughly every 500 m² per layer (with Lot consisting of ~4 tests) in normal frequency, which may be reduced (e.g. 1 per 1000 m²) if demonstrated consistent . -   Moisture Content (Uncompacted): 1 moisture ratio (Q250) test per 500 m²   per layer (normal level) to ensure correct moisture prior to compaction (Lot average of ~4 tests)   . Reduced level: 1 per 1000 m² if project allows based on consistent results. -   Insitu Testing (Post-Compaction): Thickness & Level:   Survey levels every 20 m along and across (total ~2–3 shots per 20 m) for each layer   .   Proof Roll:   Every completed Lot 100% proof rolled (entire area). Any areas showing distress are reworked and re-tested over full area. -   Ongoing Production Testing:   During production, perform at least   1 grading & PI per 500 t   (or per day’s production) to monitor consistency, and   1 Flakiness Index per 1000 t . (These frequencies often embedded in supplier’s Q&A plan under MRTS50.)  35  38  56  57   58  59  60  47  61   62  63   64  65  66  67   63  52   68  35  36  69  35   37  40  4

- | 07A 9.8. / 07B 9.8.2 |   Proof Rolling of Finished Layer   – After curing, the stabilised layer is proof rolled. Administrator witnesses to ensure no excessive deflection or surface cracking before acceptance . |   After curing period  Test Methods (Stabilised Pavements)   |   Test / Parameter   |   Test Method  -   Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS)   (7-day, lab-molded) – Strength of stabilised material | TMR Q115 (UCS of stabilised soil)   (Specimens compacted at OMC, cured 7 days) -   Binder Content   (Cement/Lime %) – Mix design proportion verification | Calculation from spread rate & depth (Check via batch tickets & area) -   Pulverisation Gradation   – Percentage of soil passing 19 mm after pulverising | AS 1289.3.6.1 (sieve on processed material) (Aim: ~100% passing 37.5 mm, > 80% passing 19 mm per spec) -   Moisture Content during mixing   – Oven drying of mixed material or speedy moisture tester | AS 1289.2.1.1 (ensure within specified range for reaction, e.g. OMC ±2%) -   Density of Compacted Layer   – Dry density ratio (field vs. assigned MDD from lab) | AS 1289.5.4.1 (field density) & AS 1289.5.2.1 (Modified compaction for MDD) -   Working Time Assessment   (Cement only) – Vicat or semi-adiabatic setting test to determine time available for compaction |   Industry practice:   VicRoads RC T144 (if applicable) -   Alignment and Level   – Survey of finished layer | Level survey (similar to unbound) to check no high/ low spots > tolerance  Acceptance Criteria (Stabilised Pavements):  -   Compaction:   Stabilised layers must be compacted to at least   97%   of Standard MDD for   lime-stabilised subgrade   , and   100%   of Standard MDD for   cement-treated base   (or as specified)   . These correspond to dense, near-refusal compaction to achieve durability and strength. In-situ density is verified by nuclear gauge or core dry density. -   Strength Gain (UCS):   If a 7-day UCS is specified (common for cement stabilisation), the average UCS of specimens must meet or exceed the design   target UCS   (e.g. 2.0 MPa for subbase, 4.0 MPa for base, as stated in Annexure). No individual cylinder to be < 0.8×target.   Example:   A CTB layer requiring 4 MPa must achieve   ≥   4 MPa average, with no result < 3.2 MPa   . Failing lots are re-treated or rejected. Lime stabilised subgrade may be assessed by CBR (e.g.   ≥   15) in lieu of UCS if specified. -   Pulverisation Quality:   After initial mixing (before compaction), material must be uniformly pulverised – typically   100% passing 37.5 mm ,   ≥   95% passing 19 mm , and clods of plastic soil fully broken down with   no lumps >   40 mm. The   PI   of the treated material should be reduced to the specified maximum (often PI   ≤   10 for subgrade) indicating proper reaction. -   Moisture Content:   During compaction, moisture must be in the specified range (often   Optimum to Opt.+2%   for cement, or a   specified moisture ratio   for lime-treated to ensure slaking). The   degree of saturation   should not exceed about 85% for cement-treated layers to avoid excess water weakening the mix   . Adequate moisture must be present for lime pozzolanic reaction (verifiable by exotherm or mellowing – e.g. soil should be 2–3% above Optimum for mellowing period). -   Thickness & Width:   The stabilised layer must meet design thickness with no deficiency.   Thickness tolerance:   usually 0 mm (negative) and +10 mm (positive) – i.e. must not be thinner than designed. Full pavement width must be treated; any untreated pockets or edges are unacceptable (check uniform color and hardness). -   Evenness & Surface Finish:   The finished surface should be tightly bound, free of loose aggregate or pulverized material, and have no surface cracks wider than hairline (minor shrinkage cracking may be expected, but   no continuous cracks > 3 mm ). Surface level tolerance is typically ±10 mm (if it’s a base for asphalt) to ensure ride quality. -   Curing:   Proper curing must be evident – e.g. for cement stabilisation, moisture curing or bitumen emulsion seal must be applied promptly. Surfaces must not be allowed to dry out and powder. Lack of curing leading to dusty, friable surface will require rectification (light spray seal or re-trim) before acceptance.  90   91  92  93   94   95  96  47  6

Test Frequencies (Stabilised Pavements):  -   Mix Design Verification:   At least   1 trial mix   per material blend in laboratory (UCS and compaction trials) prior to field work. Field trial section (as Witness Point) to verify mixing equipment and method on site before full production. -   Field Density: 1 density test per 500 m²   of stabilised area per layer (similar to unbound frequency) to confirm compaction. If smaller lots are defined, at least   3 tests per lot   . Nuclear gauge or sand replacement methods are used immediately after compaction. -   UCS Samples:   For cement-stabilised layers, typically   3 cylinders per lot   (e.g. one set per 500–1000 m² or per day’s work) are molded and cured for 7 days   . Large projects may reduce frequency once consistent (but at minimum 1 set per 2 lots). Lime stabilisation often uses periodic CBR tests (e.g. 1 per 2–3 lots) if strength confirmation needed, otherwise relies on density and curing checks. -   Moisture Checks:   During mixing, check moisture content at least   2 times per lot   – once after initial mixing and again before compaction. Use microwave or speedy moisture tester on site. If using quicklime, check “moisture ratio” of soil is sufficient for slaking (generally soil at   ≥   OPT +2%). -   Depth Checks:   Verify treatment depth by digging or coring at least   1 location per 100 m of run   (or per lot) to ensure the stabiliser has been mixed to the design depth (e.g. 250 mm). Depth can be checked by spraying indicator dye on cut face to see treated vs. untreated soil. -   Coverage & Uniformity:   Visually inspect each pass of spreader – every run is observed for any missed strips. Also, perform   spread rate check   on first run of each day (catch trays to calculate kg/m² of binder)   . Adjust spreader calibration if out of tolerance (typically ±10%). -   Post-Curing Tests:   After 7-day cure (or specified cure), take   cores   or use a lightweight deflectometer on at least   1 point per 1000 m²   to gauge in-situ strength gain indirectly. Additionally, if required, perform a   moisture sensitivity (TSR) test   on lab-compacted samples of the treated mix (usually 1 set from the trial mix) to ensure retained strength   ≥   80%.  Asphalt – Dense Graded & Open Graded Asphalt, Plus Sprayed Seals  Specification:   MRTS30 Asphalt Pavements (March 2024)   and   MRTS11 Sprayed Bituminous Treatments (July 2025)  Hold Points (Asphalt Paving)   |   Clause   |   Description of Hold Point   |   Released By  - | MRTS30 7.2.5 |   Production Re-start after TSR Failure   – If asphalt Tensile Strength Ratio (moisture susceptibility) test is nonconforming, halt production. Do not recommence asphalt manufacturing until the cause is addressed and Administrator approves restart   .

-   Moisture Sensitivity (TSR)   – Tensile Strength Ratio | TMR Q314 (6 pairs of Marshall specimens, wet vs dry strength) – acceptance TSR   ≥   80% -   Surface Texture (Seal)   – Sand Patch texture depth for seals | Austroads AG:PT/T250 (if open graded or seal texture specified) -   Binder Application Rate   – Tray weight method | Austroads AG:PT/T234 (place trays to collect sprayed binder, weigh to verify L/m²) -   Bitumen Adhesion (Aggregate Stripping)   – Aggregate crush and boil test | TMR Q205 / Austroads T236 (qualitative assessment of stripping in seal aggregate)  Acceptance Criteria (Asphalt & Seals):  -   Insitu Air Voids (Asphalt):   Compacted asphalt must achieve insitu air voids within the specified range. For dense graded asphalt,   3%   ≤   air voids   ≤   7%   (by core) is a typical requirement   . Lots with average air voids outside this range are nonconforming –   too low   (< 3% can cause flushing;   too high  (> 7% can lead to raveling)   . No individual core should fall below minimum (e.g. < 2%) or above maximum (e.g. > 8%) or the lot is rejected for corrective action (e.g. re-compaction or remove & replace). -   Laboratory Voids & Binder Film:   The job mix formula (JMF) is designed for ~4% air voids at 120 gyrations (for dense mix)   . The produced mix should meet the JMF tolerances: binder content within ±0.3%, gradation within spec ranges, and lab-compacted air voids 3–5% for SMA and 4–6% for AC (as per mix type)   . This ensures adequate binder film thickness and void structure. A mix failing JMF limits or with lab voids out of range may still be used   only if   insitu voids are achieved and Administrator approves (case-by-case)   . -   Thickness & Level:   Asphalt layer thickness must not be more than 5 mm below design. Combined asphalt course thickness must achieve the design overall thickness (no under-run). Surface course level tolerance is typically   ±5 mm   (individual) and ±3 mm mean deviation, to ensure smooth ride   . Additionally, road surface longitudinal profile and crossfall must meet ride quality specs (e.g. IRI or straightedge criteria per spec). Any areas with ponding water or high spots > 5 mm are corrected by diamond grinding or corrective rework. -   Compaction (Density):   Although insitu air voids is the primary criterion, it correlates to a minimum relative density. Generally, asphalt should be compacted to   ≥   93% of Refusal Density   (for dense mixes) which corresponds to meeting the air voids criteria. In practice, core bulk density compared to maximum theoretical density should be   ≥   93%. Lots with insufficient compaction (e.g. 91% or lower) are rejected or subject to pay deduction and require corrective measures (like additional rolling if still hot or resurfacing if cold). -   Surface Defects (Asphalt):   Finished asphalt must be free of significant segregation, drag marks, or cracking. No segregation that exposes coarse aggregate clusters is allowed –   segregated areas are repaired . No asphalt cracking; if cold joints or shrinkage cracks appear, they must be sealed or the area replaced. Surface texture should be uniform (verified by visual or Sand Patch test for OG asphalt). Open Graded Asphalt (OGA) must have voids content ~18–22% and exhibit a uniform texture (no binder pooling or dry stone areas). -   Bond to Substrate:   The asphalt layer must be well-bonded to the underlying layer. Cores taken should show asphalt fully adhered to base ( ≥   90% bond area). Any debonding or slippage (often indicated by low bond strength or visible clean separation) is unacceptable – affected areas to be cut out and replaced or drilled and injected with bitumen per spec. Tack coat coverage must be complete – no “slick” unbonded patches. -   Sprayed Seal Acceptance:   For sprayed seals,   uniform aggregate embedment ~70%   is the aim (after initial trafficking). No area should have excessive bleeding (binder flushing to surface) or patchy stone coverage. The seal shall have no strips of missed binder (indicated by obvious black lines with no aggregate). Texture depth of a new seal should meet minimum specified (e.g.   ≥   1.2 mm Sand Patch for 14 mm seal) to ensure skid resistance. Any loose aggregate after initial rolling must be within limits (usually can be swept off within 24–48 hours).   No loose stone   causing hazard – excess loose aggregate is   swept   and   if   embedment   is   inadequate   (stone   whip-off   >   5%   by   mass),   the   seal   is   deemed  120  118  121   122  121  121   123  124   125  32  9

nonconforming and requires re-sealing or sand patching   . -   Binder Properties:   Binder used (bitumen, PMB) must comply with grade requirements (viscosity, elasticity as per AS 2008 or relevant spec). If any field samples of binder (taken from sprayer) fail to meet the grade (e.g. overheating causing low viscosity), the seal is not accepted unless remedial measures (like additional cover aggregate) are approved.  Test Frequencies (Asphalt & Seals):  -   Asphalt Sampling:   Per Lot   (generally one day’s paving or ~400 t): take at least   1 set of samples per lot . This typically includes   1 bulk sample for mix grading & binder content , and   3–5 Marshall or gyratory specimens   for air voids and stability. Cores for density:   minimum 3 cores per lot   for insitu air voids and thickness   . Lots < 100 t may be combined for testing frequency, but at least one test per day of paving. -   In-Situ Voids & Thickness:   Use stratified random core locations – e.g.   3 cores per 500 t lot   (or ~1 core per 3,000 m² of mat). If lot is very large, frequency can be reduced under statistical plans but must achieve minimum confidence per spec   . Results are reported within 3 days of laying to allow timely corrective action   . -   Compaction Monitoring:   Conduct   density gauge readings behind the paver and after each roller pass   at start-up of paving (rolling pattern establishment) – not hold points but part of ITP. Also monitor surface   temperature   continuously   (IR   gun)   to   ensure   compaction   within   temperature   window. Document at least   one full density curve   at paving start for each mix and thereafter one spot-check per lot. -   Surface Regularity:   Check longitudinal levels or ride every   20 m   with a straightedge or rolling dipstick – typically   3 points across lane, every 20 m   . Also perform an IRI ride meter run at job completion (if specified, e.g. IRI < 2.0). -   Sprayed Seal Sampling:   For each binder tanker load, take   1 binder sample   (4 L) for QA (viscosity/ penetration). Perform   1 field tray test per 500 m of spray run   to verify application rate (more if varying width or binder). Document   spraying pressure, temperature, speed for each run   and have Operator’s Certificate on file (spray log to Administrator daily). -   Aggregate Spread Rate:   Check by   square patch test   – after aggregate spread, select at least   3 x 1 m² areas per 500 m   and count aggregate or weigh stone to verify spread rate is within tolerance (typically ±10% of design, e.g. 110 m²/m³ for 14 mm aggregate). Adjust spreader gates if needed; record any adjustments. -   Post-Seal Inspection:   Within   24 hours   of seal, inspect entire length for uniformity and document any bleeding or thin areas. Perform Sand Patch texture tests at   3 locations per lane-km   for dense graded seals or OG asphalt surfaces. After   7 days , do a sweep test on seal (200 mm square brushed vigorously) at   5 random locations per km   – minimal stone loss (< 5% by mass) indicates good adhesion. -   Temperature and Weather:   Record pavement and air temperature   hourly   during sealing operations. Do not spray if rain is imminent – rainfall during or within 1 hour after spraying is a   [Hold – Verification Required]   event (work should pause). All such weather interruptions are logged in the ITP with contingency actions (like cover aggregate re-roll).

Acceptance Criteria (Structural Concrete):  -   Strength:   All concrete must meet the specified   28-day characteristic compressive strength (f’c) . Acceptance is typically based on   statistical criteria   – e.g. mean of each lot   ≥   f’c + X (margin) and no individual cylinder < 0.85 f’c   . Specifically, TMR’s criteria (per Appendix A) reject a lot if   any sample < 0.9 f’c   , or if the batch mean minus 0.5 times standard deviation < f’c. Thus, consistent strength above f’c is required.   Example:   For 40 MPa concrete, no cylinder < 36 MPa, and average of 3   ≥   ~42 MPa for full acceptance. -   Workability & Placement:   Concrete must be of suitable slump to allow full compaction without segregation. The   actual slump must be within ±15 mm   (or ±25%) of the nominated slump   .   High Workability Concrete   (if used for piles etc.) must spread 500–600 mm in flow test as specified. There should be no evidence of segregation (no mortar run-off or aggregate sinkage). Concrete should completely fill forms – any honeycombing or voids are cause for repair/rejection. -   Reinforcement & Cover:   Reinforcement positioning must comply: bars located within ±10 mm of design position, and   concrete cover   ≥   specified minimum   (e.g.   ≥   50 mm for cast-in-place piles)   . No bars should be exposed or too close to surface. Chair spacing such that bars remain stable during pour (check no visible movement during concreting). If post-pour cover survey finds cover deficiency beyond tolerance, remedial measures (grout cover, additional protection) are required. -   Dimensional Tolerance:   Dimensions of formed concrete elements shall be within tolerance class per AS 3610 (generally   ±10 mm   for linear dimensions,   ±3 mm   for thickness of slabs, or as specified). Vertical deviation (plumb) of columns/walls should not exceed   H/1000   or 25 mm (whichever smaller). Position of cast-in items (bolts, ducts) to be within ±5 mm. Surfaces must meet flatness requirements: typically  Class 2 finish   – no abrupt offsets > 3 mm and gradual undulations within 5 mm under a 3 m straightedge   . -   Curing & Durability:   Concrete must be effectively cured for the specified period (e.g. 7 days moist  132  143  144  144  138  132  132  12

--- Page 13 ---
curing or equivalent). Any curing lapse that causes surface drying is a non-conformance unless proven strength/durability not compromised. Surface finish should show no uncontrolled cracking. Acceptable cracks: very narrow (< 0.2 mm) plastic shrinkage cracks might be tolerated if infrequent, but any pattern cracking or full-depth cracks are not accepted without engineer evaluation.   Per MRTS70, any crack > 0.1 mm wide in exposure class XD/XS must be epoxy injected or otherwise rectified.  -   Pile Integrity:   For cast-in-place piles, integrity testing must indicate sound concrete throughout length –   no significant shaft defects . Typically,   Pile Integrity Factor > 0.7   on low-strain impact tests is required, and any suspicious signals (e.g. major reflections) trigger further investigation or core drilling . Geotechnical capacity must be certified – each pile’s embedment in competent strata is confirmed by downhole inspection or driving log. Any pile not attaining required toe depth or having voids at base (e.g. > 50 mm debris) is either remediated (cleaned and re-poured) or subject to design re-evaluation. -   Grouting & Tensioning:   All grouted ducts (post-tension) must be 100% filled; subsequent inspection by coring or non-destructive means may be required if voids suspected. Tendons should achieve the specified   jacking force ±5%   and   elongation within ±7%   of theoretical. Any tendon not meeting criteria holds further works until resolved.  Test Frequencies (Structural Concrete):  -   Strength Testing:   For each concrete grade, cast at least   1 set of 3 cylinders per 50 m³ or per pour  (whichever gives more frequency) – with   a minimum of 1 set per day per grade   . Additional cylinders may be made for 7-day or earlier stripping tests as needed. For critical elements (columns, PT beams), often   2 sets per 50 m³   (one for 7-day, one for 28-day). -   Slump & Air:   Perform a   slump test on every truck   initially until consistency proven, then at least   one slump test per 5 m³   (or per batch if site batching) continuing. If concrete is air-entrained (for exposure class), test air content   on first 3 loads   and then   every 50 m³   or change in material. Always test slump/ air when making strength cylinders. -   Temperature & Time:   Record concrete temperature   every truck   upon discharge and note time since batching – ensuring spec limits (e.g. 32 °C max and 90 min max). If any exceedance, that load is rejected (documented in ITP). -   Cover Surveys:   After form stripping, check cover depth at   a minimum of 5 points per member   (or every 3 m for long members) using a cover meter. This is typically done for 10% of members as an audit if uniform work, or more if issues found. Document results in conformance report. -   Pile Inspection:   For each bored pile, conduct a   down-the-hole inspection   (DTI) – either by personnel (if diameter > 750 mm and dry) or by camera (for smaller or wet holes). This is done   for every pile   prior to placing concrete   . The ITP should note that the base cleanliness is checked (via camera recording or inspector’s log) and socket depth measured for each pile. Additionally, perform   low-strain PIT on 100% of piles   after 7–14 days of casting (when concrete   ≥   70% f’c) unless waived by the Administrator . Any anomalies lead to further testing on those piles (e.g. cross-hole sonic on 1 in 5 piles, if ducts installed). -   Frequency of Other Tests:   If concrete durability tests (e.g. RCPT, shrinkage) are specified: typically   1 test per mix   initially (trial or first pour) and then   one every 50 m³   or as per spec. For example, drying shrinkage might be one set of prisms per lot for a bridge deck concrete requiring   ≤   500 microstrain at 56 days. -   Post-Pour Checks:   Inspect formwork surfaces within   24 hours of stripping   for defects – document any honeycombing (frequency: all members). Also check each construction joint surface for laitance removal before continuing adjacent pour (100% joints). -   Steel Material Testing:   Ensure mill certificates for each batch of rebar are provided (100% batches) and undertake random tensile tests on steel – typically   one sample per 30 t   of each bar size as per MRTS71 (if not already pre-qualified). Though not directly in MRTS70, it forms part of structural concrete quality. Each test result is attached to ITP records.  145  144  146  147  13
